The <a data-href=\"Transitive Closure\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Transitive Closure</a> of a directed graph represents which vertices are reachable from others.

Equality is an example of a symmetric relation.<br>An equivalence relation is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

An example of a proposition is the sentence, \"Tomorrow is Thursday\", since it's either true or false.<br>\nPropositional logic is <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Monotonicity\" data-href=\"Monotonicity\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Monotonic</a>, meaning that when you add knowledge to a propositional <a data-href=\"Knowledge Base\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Knowledge Base</a>, it cannot lead to the loss of previously established truths.Propositional logic is made up of:\nPropositional Symbols: Symbols that start with an uppercase letter and refer to a proposition. For example, , , and are examples of propositional symbols. Each symbol represents a distinct statement that can be true or false. Individual symbols are commonly referred to as literals. A literal is negative if there is a negation applied to it (e.g. ), else, it's a positive literal.\nLogical Connectives: Operators which combine propositional symbols to create complex sentences. The primary logical connectives include: Negation (NOT, ¬)\nConjunction (AND, ∧)\nDisjunction (OR, ∨)\nImplication (IMPLIES, →)\nBiconditional (IF AND ONLY IF, ↔) Atomic Sentence: An atomic sentence consists of a single propositional symbol and represents a basic assertion.\nComplex Sentence: A complex sentence is made up of propositional symbols connected by parenthesis and logical connectives. They are also called formulas.\nPropositional logic is often seen as a precursor to more complex logic systems including:\n<br><a data-href=\"First-Order Logic\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/first-order-logic.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">First-Order Logic</a>: Extends propositional logic by introducing quantifiers and predicates, allowing for the representation of the relationships between objects.\n<br><a data-href=\"Modal Logic\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Modal Logic</a>: Incorporates modalities like possibility, necessity, or knowledge.\n<br><a data-href=\"Temporal Logic\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Temporal Logic</a>: Allows for reasoning about change over time by introducing temporal operators.\n<br><a data-href=\"Automated Theorem Proving\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Automated Theorem Proving</a>: Uses propositional logic as the basis for many theorem proving techniques.\n<br>Negation flips the truth value of the propositional symbol it is applied to. Negating gives , which can be understood in English as \"not \". The <a data-href=\"Truth Table\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Truth Table</a> for negation is as follows:A conjunction of two conjuncts is true only if both of its conjuncts is true. This can be understood in English as \"and\", and is denoted in propositional logic with the symbol . The truth table for conjunction is as follows:A disjunction of two disjuncts is true if either of its disjuncts are true. This can be understood as the English word \"or\", meaning if one or the other is true, then the disjunction is true. Disjunction is denoted with the symbol . The truth table for disjunction is as follows:An Implication is a binary operator with its left-hand side being the premise, and the right-hand side being the conclusion. An implication states that if the premise is true, then the premise must be true. Implications can be thought of as if-then statements and are denoted with the symbols or . An implication is only false if its premise is true, while the conclusion is false. The truth table for implication is as follows:As shown in the truth table above, an implication is always true if its premise is false. This occurs because the sentence provides no information. It is like saying, \"If , which is false, were true, then \". Since is false, the sentence holds no substantive meaning.\nThe concept of vacuous truth will be relevant later in the Mathematical Induction subsection, particularly in establishing base cases.A biconditional can be thought of as double implication, meaning both sides imply the other. Biconditionals are true only if both symbols are the same truth value. The symbols used to denote biconditional is or , and can be thought of in English as \"if and only if\". The truth table for a biconditional is:A NAND can be thought of as a negation applied to a conjunction, . A NAND is true as long as one of its operands it false. It's represented symbolically as or as , and has the following truth table:A XOR, or exclusive or, is true when exactly one of its operands is true. It can be thought of as the English word 'or', in the context of when only one thing or the other is the case. XOR is denoted using the symbol, and its truth table is as follows:A NOR can be thought of as a negation applied to an OR operator, . A NOR is true only when both of its operands are false and is represented symbolically as . The truth table for NOR is as follows: A XNOR can be thought of as a negation applied to the XOR gate, . Where a XOR is true only when both of its operands are different, a XNOR is true only when both of its operands are the same. It has the same truth table as a biconditional, which is as follows:The order of precedence of logical connectives is as follows:\nNegation (NOT, ¬)\nConjunction (AND, ∧)\nDisjunction (OR, ),\nImplication (IMPLIES, →)\nBiconditional (IF AND ONLY IF, ↔)\n<br>Two sentences are said to be logically equivalent if they have the same truth table. This is denoted using the symbol. A <a data-href=\"Rule of Replacement\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rule of Replacement</a> is a logical principle that allows for the substitution of one logical expression, for another, logically equivalent expression. Rules of replacement are used to construct proofs, simply logical expressions, and verify the correctness of logical statements. Propositional equivalence is vital for many domains, including:\n<br>Digital Logic Design: Used to simplify expressions in <a data-href=\"Boolean Algebra\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Boolean Algebra</a>, thereby optimizing and simplifying digital circuits.\n<br>Artificial Intelligence: Used to in <a data-href=\"Knowledge Representation\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Knowledge Representation</a> as well as inference algorithms, to derive new facts from an existing <a data-href=\"Knowledge Base\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Knowledge Base</a>.\n<br><a data-href=\"Control Theory\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Control Theory</a>: Used for simplifying systems equations, analyze conditions, and modeling states and transitions.\nMathematical Proofs: Used to transform sentences into equivalent forms which are easier to prove.\nThe double negation law is a rule of replacement which states that, when negation is applied twice to an expression, the truth table for that expression remains the same. This is because the second negation 'cancels out' the first one, leaving only the original expression left.\nThe identity laws state that, any proposition conjoined with a true value, is logically equivalent to the proposition alone. For disjunction, any proposition disjoined with a false value, is logically equivalent to the proposition alone. This is because it both cases, the expression's truth value relies entirely on the value of the proposition.\nThe domination laws state that, any proposition conjoined with a false value is always false, and any proposition disjoined with a true value is always true. This is because, in the case of conjunction, the AND operation requires both operands to be true for the result to be true. Since one operand is false, the entire expression cannot be true, regardless of the value of the other operand. In the case of disjunction, the OR operation requires at least one operand to be true for the result to be true. Since one operand is true, the entire expression will always evaluate to true.\nThe idempotent laws state that a proposition conjoined or disjoined with itself is logically equivalent to the proposition alone. This means that applying conjunction or disjunction to a proposition with itself multiple times yields the same truth table as the original proposition.\nThe distributive laws describe how conjunction (AND) and disjunction (OR) interact with each other in propositional logic, allowing us to distribute one operation over the other.\nThe first distributive law states that a conjunction of with disjunction of and is logically equivalent to the disjunction of AND with AND R.\nThe second distributive law states that the disjunction of with the conjunction of and is logically equivalent to the conjunction of OR with OR .\nDe Morgan's Laws consist of two rules of replacement which define the relationship between disjunctions and conjunctions through negation.\nDe Morgan's first law states that the negation of a conjunction is logically equivalent to the disjunction of the negated conjuncts. This is directly equivalent to the definition of the NAND operator and can be seen as a direct implementation of De Morgan's first law.\nDe Morgan's second law states that the negation of a disjunction is logically equivalent to the conjunction of the negated disjuncts. This is directly equivalent to the definition of the NOR operator and can be seen as a direct implementation of De Morgan's second law.\n<br>The <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/commutative-property.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"4\" to=\"15\" origin-text=\"commutative\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">commutative</a> laws state that the order of operands in a conjunction and disjunction are logically equivalent.\n<br>The <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/associative-property.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"4\" to=\"15\" origin-text=\"associative\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">associative</a> laws state that the grouping of operands in a conjunction or disjunction does not affect the truth value of expression.\nA clause is a disjunction/conjunction of literals. When talking about clauses, usually it refers to a disjunctive clause, which is a logical expression formed by connecting literals with the OR operator.\nThe empty clause is a clause with no literals, commonly denoted as , , or . An empty disjunctive clause is always false, making it analogous to a contradiction. This is an important concept in proof by contradiction, as reaching an empty clause indicates that a contradiction has been proven.A Horn clause is a disjunctive clause with at most one positive literal.\nDefinite Clause: If a Horn clause has exactly one positive literal, it is a definite clause. For example, .\nGoal Clause: If it has no positive literals, it is a goal clause. For example, .\nA Horn clause can be represented in disjunctive form:\nA Horn clause can also be represented in implicative form:\nIn both cases, is the only positive literal.<br>Horn clauses are computationally efficient for algorithms such as <a data-href=\"Resolution Theorem Proving\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Resolution Theorem Proving</a>, or for <a data-href=\"Forward/Backward Chaining\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Forward/Backward Chaining</a>. This makes them the basis of many <a data-href=\"Logic Programming\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Logic Programming</a> languages, as well as for automated theorem proving or database querying.A sentence is considered to be in conjunctive normal form (CNF) if it's a conjunction (AND) of one or more clauses.\nEvery sentence in propositional logic can be converted into an equivalent CNF form using the following steps:\nImplication/biconditional elimination (will be discussed later)\nMoving Negations Inward using De Morgan's laws.\nDouble negation elimination\nUsing the distributive property to distribute OR over AND, for example: A sentence is considered to be in disjunctive normal form (DNF) if it is a disjunction (OR) of conjunctions (AND).\nEvery sentence in propositional logic can be converted to DNF in the following steps:\nImplication/biconditional elimination\nMoving Negations Inward using De Morgan's laws.\nDouble negation elimination\nUsing the distributive property to distribute AND over OR, for example: <br>In logic, an argument consists of a set of sentences called premises, which, if all are true, the conclusion sentence must follow. This is a form of reasoning called <a data-href=\"Deductive Reasoning\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Deductive Reasoning</a> which uses general statements to derive specific conclusions.<br>Logical entailment, or logical consequence, refers to a relationship between premises and a conclusion. The conclusion is said to be entailed by the premises if there is no assignment of truth values such that the premises are true while the conclusion is false. In other words, entailment states that the conclusion follows the premises; whenever the premises are true, so is the conclusion. Entailment is closely related to the idea of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Tautology\" data-href=\"Tautology\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">tautologies</a>, as tautologies represent statements that are universally true and can help establish the validity of entailments.\nEntailment is represented symbolically as . For example: Valid: An argument is valid if its conclusion must follow its premises. Meaning that if the argument's premises are true, then the conclusion must be true as well, otherwise, the argument is invalid.\nSound: An argument is sound if its premises are true. If any of its premises are false, then the argument is unsound.\nSatisfiable: A formula is satisfiable if there is at least one assignment of truth values which makes the formula true. If there is no assignment of truth values to make the formula true, then it is unsatisfiable, also called a contradiction.\nIf an argument is valid and sound, then its conclusion must be true. A sound argument is always valid, while a valid argument may be unsound.\nArgument forms are patterns or templates that represent valid structures for arguments.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Syllogism\" data-href=\"Syllogism\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Syllogisms</a> are argument forms that consist of two premises which support a conclusion.\nModus Ponens is a syllogistic argument form and rule of inference. It has the following structure:\nIf then .\n.\nTherefore, .\n<br>The first two sentences are the arguments premises, and the final sentence is the conclusion. Modus Ponens is represented in <a data-href=\"Gentzen Notation\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gentzen Notation</a> as:\nModus Tollens is another valid syllogistic argument form, similar to Modus Ponens. Though, unlike Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens affirms the negation of antecedent from the negation of the consequent. The structure of Modus Tollens is as follows:\nIf then .\n.\nTherefore, .\nLike Modus Ponens, the first two sentences are the arguments premises, and the final sentence is the conclusion. Modus Tollens is represented symbolically as:\nA disjunctive syllogism is a syllogistic argument form with a disjunction as one of its premises. It says that if one of the two disjuncts is true, and we know that one is false, then the other must be true. The structure of disjunctive syllogisms is as follows: or .\n.\nTherefore, .\nIn Gentzen notation:\n<br>A hypothetical syllogism, also called the chain rule, is an argument form which uses the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Transitive Property\" data-href=\"Transitive Property\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/transitive-property.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">transitive property</a> of implication. The structure of a hypothetical syllogism is as follows:\nIf then .\nIf then .\nTherefore, if then .\nHypothetical syllogisms are represented in Gentzen notation as:\nRules of inference are logical rules that dictate derivations of conclusions from premises. Rules of inference differ from rules of replacement which state that two expressions are logically equivalent and can be freely swapped for one another.Implication introduction is a rule of inference which is used to express implications in terms of disjunctions. The rule is as follows:\nImplication introduction is crucial when converting formulas to normal forms like CNF or DNF.Biconditional introduction is a rule of inference which allow for the inference of a biconditional from two implications:\nThis transformation can also be done the opposite way, called biconditional elimination, where two implications can be inferred from a biconditional:\nand:\nConjunction introduction is a rule of inference which states that if two propositions are known to be true, then there conjunction is also known to be true:\nConjunction elimination states that if the conjunction of two propositions is known to be true, then either of its conjuncts is also known to be true:\nDisjunction introduction is a rule of inference which states that if a proposition is known to be true, any disjunction it is a part of is also known to be true:\nDisjunction elimination works the opposite way, stating that if you have a disjunction where each disjunct implies a third proposition , then can be inferred:\nIn propositional logic, proofs are essential for establishing the truth of a statement or the validity of an argument. A proof is a demonstration that a conclusion follows from a set of premises.<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Proof System\" data-href=\"Proof System\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Proof Systems</a> are frameworks which provide the structure and methodology for constructing proofs. Proof systems are made up of:\nAxioms: Foundational propositions that are accepted as true without having been proven.\nRules of Inference: Rules which provide the structure for how new statements can be derived from existing ones.\nSyntax: The symbols used to represent statements.\nSemantics: The interpretation of the meaning of the statements within the proof system.\nThe most common proof systems include Natural Deduction and Sequent Calculus.\nA proof system is complete if every statement that is semantically true can be proven within that system. Otherwise, the system is incomplete.\nA tautology is a propositional formula which is true for all possible assignments of truth values. A contradiction is a formula that is always false for all possible assignments of truth values.\nMany proof techniques rely on tautologies and contradictions to prove that a particular formula entails another, or to prove that a particular formula is unsatisfiable. A direct proof is one of the most common and straightforward methods for deriving conclusions. The structure of a direct proof is as follows:\nIdentify the premises: Clearly state the premises which you will use to derive the conclusion.\nState the conclusion: State the conclusion you wish to prove from the premises.\nLogical deduction: Use the rules of inference to derive the conclusion from the premises step by step.\nProof by contradiction is an indirect proof that assumes the conclusion is false, then proves that this assumption leads to a contradiction. If assuming the conclusion is false does lead to a contradiction, then the conclusion must be true. The structure of a proof by contradiction is as follows:\nIdentify the premises: Clearly state the premises which you will use to derive the conclusion.\nState the conclusion: State the conclusion you wish to prove from the premises.\nAssume the negation: Assume that the conclusion is false.\nLogical deduction: Use the rules of inference to derive a contradiction. A contradiction typically manifests as the empty sentence , which is a statement that is always false.\nConclude the Conclusion: If the assumption that the conclusion is false did lead to a contradiction, then the original conclusion must be true.\nProof by contrapositive is an indirect proof which proves a conclusion by proving its contrapositive. Since a sentence and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, proving one proves the other. The structure for a proof by contrapositive is as follows:\nState the conclusion: State the conclusion you wish to prove, for example, .\nIdentify the contrapositive: Identify the contrapositive of the conclusion, for example, .\nLogical deduction: Use the rules of inference to prove the contrapositive.\nConclude the Original Implication: If the contrapositive can be proven, then the original conclusion is also proven.\nResolution resolves two clauses which contain complementary literals. Two literals are complements of one another if one is the negation of the other (e.g. and ). Resolution is defined:\nThe above example resolves and resulting in a new clause called the resolvent.<br>\nIn the context of <a data-href=\"Resolution Theorem Proving\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Resolution Theorem Proving</a>, resolution is applied repeatedly to derive a contradiction, thereby proving that the negation of the statement that's being proven, is unsatisfiable. Ensuring all formulas are in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) dramatically improves the efficiency of resolution-based automated theorem proving.Mathematical induction is a proof technique for statements that apply to all natural numbers. It starts with proving the base case—typically or . Then the inductive hypothesis assumes that the formula is true for some arbitrary natural number , where . Then, using this assumption, the inductive step involves proving the formula holds for .\nFor example, let's say were trying to inductively prove : The base case, where , is:\nNow, we assume the inductive hypothesis is true:\nUsing the assumption, the inductive step involves proving:\nUsing Algebra, we get:\nTherefore, is true for all natural number greater than or equal to 1.\n<br>Artificial Intelligence: Propositional logic is used for knowledge representation, <a data-href=\"Decision Theory\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Decision Theory</a>, and inference algorithms in AI agents.\n<br><a data-href=\"Automated Theorem Proving\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Automated Theorem Proving</a>: Uses propositional logic as the basis for many theorem proving techniques.

Ernad Mujakic\nDate: 2025-07-02Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the analysis of events and their likelihood of occurring. The probability of an event, written is a number between 0 and 1, with 0 representing impossible and 1 representing certainty. Probability theory is a framework for making inferences of events that have elements of uncertainty or randomness within them or their outcomes. Random Experiment - any process or action that yields uncertain outcomes.Sample Space - commonly denoted as , is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.Event - a subset of the sample space, representing specific outcomes.Power Set: The set of all possible subsets of a sample space, including the empty set or .The probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total size of the sample space:Joint probability is the probability of 2 events happening simultaneously. If 2 events are independent, then their joint probability is:If 2 events are mutually exclusive, then the probability of one or the other occurring is equal to the sum of their probabilities:If 2 events aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, then you simply subtract their intersection in order to prevent counting the values in their intersection twice:The probability of one event occurring, given that another has already occurred, denoted as (the probability of A given B), is:Bayes' Theorem states that:\nNon-Negativity: The probability of an event can never be negative: Normalization: The probability of an entire sample space is always 1: Countable Additivity: The probability of any countable sequence of disjoint (mutually exclusive) events, is equal to the sum of the probabilities of the individual events: Complement Rule: The complement of is denoted as or and is equal to: Mutual Exclusivity: If events A and B are mutually exclusive, that is they can never occur simultaneously, then: Empty Set: The probability of the empty set is always 0: <a data-href=\"Law of Total Probability\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Law of Total Probability</a>: If events are mutually exclusive and form a partition of the sample space, and is any event, the law of total probability states: <br><a data-href=\"Central Limit Theorem\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Central Limit Theorem</a>: States that if we take random samples from any population, the <a data-href=\"Mean\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/mean.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mean</a> of those samples will form a normal distribution as the sample size gets sufficiently large.\n<br><a data-href=\"Law of Large Numbers\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Law of Large Numbers</a>: States that the <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/mean.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"18\" to=\"22\" origin-text=\"mean\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">mean</a> of the outcomes obtained from a large number of independent samples will converge to the expected value of the underlying probability distribution.\nThe factorial of a non-negative integer , denoted , is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to :\nA permutation of a set is a possible arrangement of its elements, where the order of the elements matters. The number of possible permutations of elements from a set with total elements is given by:\nA combination of a set is a selection of its elements where the order does not matter.

Outliers may occur due to measurement or recording error, or could possibly represent an important anomaly warranting further analysis. There is no fixed definition of what constitutes as an outlier, typically, specific domain knowledge is usually necessary to understand whether a specific observation is an outlier, or is a natural phenomenon of the dataset.\nMeasurement Error: Outliers may occur due to user error in the data collection process, or could occur due to errors in autonomous systems, such as sensor failure.\nNatural Variation: Outliers may represent perfectly legitimate values that are an inherent part of the naturally occurring variations in the underlying domain of the dataset.\nAnomaly: Outliers may represent unusual behavior, such as fraudulent transactions, which warrant further investigation and analysis. Outliers can have a significant impact on various statistical measures, such as <a data-href=\"Mean\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/mean.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mean</a>, <a data-href=\"Standard Deviation\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/standard-deviation.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Standard Deviation</a>, or <a data-href=\"Range\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/range.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Range</a>.\n<br>Outliers could also hinder the performance of some machine learning models such as <a data-href=\"Logistic Regression\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Logistic Regression</a> or <a data-href=\"K-Nearest-Neighbors\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">K-Nearest-Neighbors</a>. Global Outliers: A global outlier deviates significantly from the entire population globally.\nCollective Outliers: A group or subset of data points that collectively deviate considerably from the overall distribution. Typically, require special techniques to detect.\nContextual/Local Outliers: Data points whose value deviate significantly relative to other data points within the same \"context.\" Contextual outliers may not be considered outliers when considered globally, meaning they need special attention to be properly detected and analyzed.\nWhile the terms outliers and extreme values may be used interchangeably, they have distinct definitions in statistics:\nOutlier: is a data point that varies significantly from the rest of the dataset.\nExtreme values: values that reside at the outer edges of the dataset, representing the highest and lowest points in a dataset.

Though, this approach is not effective for collective outliers.DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that clusters data based on the density of data points. DBSCAN excels at identifying an arbitrary number of clusters, and can handle nested clusters of arbitrary shapes.\nTwo parameters are chosen, represents the radius within which to classify neighbors; and minPts, which represents the minimum number of neighbors within to classify the point as a \"core point.\"\nA data point is considered a core point if the amount of other data points that falls within its radius is at least minPts.\nAfter all core points are identified, for each core point, create a cluster of the core point and all the points within its radius.\nExpand the cluster by iterating through all reachable points and adding them to the cluster if they're core points.\nPoints that are not reachable from any core points are labelled as noise or outliers.\nDBSCAN is popular algorithm for anomaly detection, since outliers are detected based on relative density of data.<br>One straightforward method for dealing with outliers is simply to remove them from the dataset. This approach if effective as long as outliers are not relevant to the analysis, such as the case where the focus is not on <a data-href=\"Anomaly Detection\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Anomaly Detection</a>.Transformations can be applied to the data to minimize the effect of outliers.

The trimmed mean offers a more stable measure that is less affected by outliers, making it valuable across various disciplines.In a weighted mean, instead of each value contributing equally like in an arithmetic mean, each value is assigned a weight (or coefficient) based on its significance. This allows for a more nuanced average that reflects the importance of different contributions. The arithmetic mean is a weighted mean where all weights are equal.The formula for calculating the weighted mean is:<br>The weighted mean is used when there is a need to model the relative importance of various attributes. This is commonly seen in artificial intelligence techniques such as <a data-href=\"Ensemble Machine Learning\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ensemble Machine Learning</a> algorithms.The harmonic mean calculates the average of a set of numbers that are defined in relation to some unit. It is calculated by taking the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of each value in the dataset.The formula for the harmonic mean is:<br>In <a data-href=\"Machine Learning\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Machine Learning</a>, the harmonic mean is commonly used to calculate the <a data-href=\"F1 Score\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">F1 Score</a> of a model. It is also commonly used when analyzing speed and rates, such as finding the average speed of multiple segments of a journey.<br>The geometric mean calculates the average of a set of values by using the product of values rather than their sum. It involves multiplying all the values in the dataset and then taking the th root of that product, where is the total number of values in the set. The geometric mean is less susceptible to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Outlier\" data-href=\"Outlier\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/outlier.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">outliers</a> than the arithmetic mean since each value is part of a product rather than a sum.It is called the geometric mean because it's commonly used to find the side length of a square that has the same area as a rectangle with given side lengths. For example, if you have a rectangle with dimensions , the length of a square with equal volume is the geometric mean of and , which is .The formula for the geometric mean is:<br>The geometric mean is commonly used to calculate average rates of return on investments over time. The geometric mean can also be employed in <a data-href=\"Data Normalization\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Data Normalization</a> to normalize features, particularly when the values span multiple orders of magnitude.The root mean square (RMS), often denoted as , is an average of the magnitude of a set of values, and is and is also known as the quadratic mean. It is particularly useful in sets with values of both positive and negative numbers. RMS is calculated by taking the square root of the arithmetic average of the squared values.For a continuous function defined over the interval , the RMS is determined by squaring the function, averaging the squared values over the interval, and then taking the square root of that average.The formula for discrete RMS is:The formula for continuous RMS is:Root-mean square is widely used in signal processing the measure the power of AC currents and voltages. In regression analysis, the RMS error is a common metric for evaluation the performance of a model. RMS is also used to evaluate the performance of control systems regarding the stability and responsiveness to input signals.

Test","icon":"","description":"Author: Ernad Mujakic\nDate: 2025-07-02A Turing test is a benchmark proposed by Alan Turing for evaluating a machine's ability to exhibit intelligence that is indistinguishable from that of a human. The test involves three participants, a human interrogator, a human respondent, and a machine. The interrogator communicates with both the human and machine via text, if the judge is unable to confidently identify which agent is the human and which is the machine, then the machine passes the Turing test. The result does not depend on the machine's ability to respond correctly, , only on how close the machine's language resembles human natural language. The CAPTCHA system is a famous implementation of a Turing test.To pass a Turing test a machine must have <a data-href=\"Natural Language Processing\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Natural Language Processing</a> and generating abilities. The machine also needs some form of <a data-href=\"Knowledge Representation\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Knowledge Representation</a> to be able to keep track of conversation, as well as <a data-href=\"Reasoning\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Reasoning</a>, so that the machine demonstrates some form of rationality to the interrogator.<br>There is an extension of the Turing test known as the total Turing test, where the machine has to also exhibit human sensory abilities and physical interactions. In this instance, the machine would also need robust <a data-href=\"Robotics\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Robotics</a>, <a data-href=\"Computer Vision\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Computer Vision</a>, <a data-href=\"Speech Recognition\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Speech Recognition</a>, navigation, and physical manipulation capabilities as well as a physical appearance that is indistinguishable from a human.One of the strengths of the Turing test lies in its simplicity. The test is straightforward to implement and understand which encourages broader participation in the realm of AI research.The Turing test is particularly versatile, allowing it to be applied to various forms of AI models, making it relevant across sub-disciplines within artificial intelligence research. The evaluation metrics of the test are also simple to expand or contract if specific capabilities would like to be included or excluded, such as computer vision or robotics. This allows researchers to tailor their assessment based on the goals of their project, rather than trying to conform to specific parameters of the test.Due to its subjective nature, the Turing Test is susceptible to human variability, as different interrogators may perceive specific behaviors as \"human-like\" or intelligent in varying ways. This inherent subjectivity can lead to inconsistent results, which undermines the test's reliability as a benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence systems. As a result, the effectiveness and usefulness of the Turing test as a measure for machine intelligence has been heavily scrutinized by various researchers in the field of AI.Since the Turing Test focuses primarily on actions and behaviors, it overlooks the underlying processes that lead to the formulation of those behaviors, raising questions about whether those processes truly reflect intelligence. Many computer scientists argue that analyzing actions and behaviors alone is insufficient for determining whether a machine possesses intelligence. This critique emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive evaluation that considers not only observable outputs but also the mechanisms which deliver those outputs.Some critics of the Turing Test argue that the focus of AI research should be on augmenting or improving human behavior rather than merely mimicking it. They point out that certain human behaviors are inherently unintelligent, while some intelligent behaviors may be fundamentally inhuman. For example, a machine might deliberately avoid providing a correct answer to a challenging mathematical question to avoid raising suspicion with the interrogator. Some believe that this approach represents a misguided use of research efforts, diverting attention from the potential of AI to enhance human capabilities and solve complex problems.\n<br>Wikipedia contributors, “Turing test,” Wikipedia, Jun. 24, 2025. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test#Tractability_and_simplicity\" target=\"_self\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test#Tractability_and_simplicity</a>\n<br>GeeksforGeeks, “Turing Test in artificial intelligence,” GeeksforGeeks, Sep. 16, 2024. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/turing-test-artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_self\">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/turing-test-artificial-intelligence/</a>\nPeter.

A cost function quantifies the cost of a particular action or sequence of actions. Something is 'stochastic' if it exhibits uncertainty. <br>\nA <a data-href=\"Markov Model\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Markov Model</a> is a system where the following state depends only on the current state. A Markov Process is a stochastic process that satisfies the Markov Model. A <a data-href=\"Hidden Markov Model\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hidden Markov Model</a> is a statistical model that represents systems that transition between different hidden states, while perceiving observable outputs. <br>\nA <a data-href=\"Bayesian Network\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bayesian Network</a> is a probabilistic model implemented as a directed acyclic graph that represents a set of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Random Variable\" data-href=\"Random Variable\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Random Variables</a> and their conditional dependencies, as well as a set of conditional <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/probability.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"69\" to=\"80\" origin-text=\"probability\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">probability</a> distribution tables. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Agent\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Agent</a> - Anything that can perceive its environment with sensors and act upon it with actuators. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Percept Sequence\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Percept Sequence</a> - Everything an agent has perceived. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Agent Function\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Agent Function</a> - An abstract mathematical function that maps percept sequences to actions. Agent Program - A concrete implementation of some abstract agent function. Performance Measure - Evaluates the desirability of an outcome. Information Gathering - Performing potentially sub-optimal actions in order to perceive new information about the environment. Rationality maximizes expected performance based on the knowledge available. What is rational at a given time-step is based on the agent's performance measure, its available actions, its prior knowledge of the environment, as well as its percept sequence up until that time-step. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Task Environment\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Task Environment</a> - The factors that determine how an agent operates. The task environment consists of the performance measure, sensors, actuators, and external environment. A task environment can be fully observable, meaning the agent's sensors give it complete knowledge about all relevant variables of the environment at all times. A Task environment is partially observable if the sensors provide a noisy or incomplete description of the actual state at any time step. A task environment is single agent if there is only one actor that influences the environment, else, it is a multi-agent environment. <br>\nA task environment is deterministic if the next state is completely determined by the current state and the action taken. Otherwise, the environment is nondeterministic or stochastic. An environment is uncertain if there is uncertainty in either the <a data-href=\"Sensor Model\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sensor Model</a> - which returns the perceived output of the current state, or if there is uncertainty in the <a data-href=\"Transition Model\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Transition Model</a> - which returns the next state based on the current state and the action taken. Together the transition and sensor model allow the agent to keep track of the state of the world . A task environment is episodic if the sequence of states are divided into atomic episodes, that is, the next state (episode) does not depend on the actions from previous states. A task environment is sequential if actions at any given state can impact the actions taken in future states. A task environment is dynamic if it can change while the agent is deliberating, otherwise, the environment is static. If the environment itself doesn't change but the passage of time impacts the agent's performance measure, the environment is considered semi-dynamic. <br>\nAn environment is known if the outcomes (or <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Probability\" data-href=\"Probability\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/probability.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">probabilities</a> of outcomes) of actions are given. Otherwise, the environment is unknown and the agent will have to learn the result of its actions. Discrete variables can take on distinct, separate values. <br>\nContinuous variables can take on any value in a <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/range.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"28\" to=\"33\" origin-text=\"range\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">range</a>. Simple Reflex Agent - An agent that selects an action that selects based only on the current percept. Is susceptible to infinite loops in partially-observable environments which can be avoided if the agent selects actions with an element of randomization. Model-Based Reflex Agent - An agent which maintains an internal state which is constructed based on the percept history. The agent's internal state keeps track of the result of actions, as well as how the world evolves independent of itself. Goal-Based Agent - An agent that maintains a current state description as well as goal information which determines the desirability of a state or action. Though, goals treat all non-goal states with equal desirability which leads to poor performance. <br>\nUtility-Based Agent - Instead of a goal, the agent has a <a data-href=\"Utility Function\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Utility Function</a> which assigns a continuous value to a state or action, allowing the agent to act in such a way that maximizes its utility function. The utility function is simply and internalization of the agent's performance measure, in the case where all an agent's current actions lead to non-goal states, a utility-based agent will choose the action that leads to the \"best\" state, rather than treating each action as equal like a goal-based agent would. Utility also allows an agent to rationally deal with multiple goals by selecting the goal with the maximum utility. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Learning Agent\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Learning Agent</a> - An agent that can learn and improve from experience or training. A learning agent can be any of the mentioned types. Learning agents typically consist of four main components: Learning Element - The element responsible for making improvements.\nPerformance Element - The element responsible for selecting external actions. The performance element is what we previously considered as the entire agent.\nCritic - The element which provides feedback to the learning element on how well the agent is performing. Problem-solving agent: an agent that needs to plan, and consider a sequence of actions to reach a goal. Search: the computational process a problem-solving agent undertakes. <br>\nAn algorithm is informed if the agent can estimate its proximity to the goal using a <a data-href=\"Heuristic\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Heuristic</a>. Otherwise, the algorithm is uninformed. A problem-solving agent: Formulates its goal\nDevises a description of the states and actions needed to reach its goal.\nSimulates a sequence of actions until it finds a solution.\nExecutes the solution, if one is found. An system is considered open-loop if it ignores its percepts while executing its solution. This is done so if the environment is known and deterministic, meaning the agent needs not to keep track of its percepts. <br>A system is closed-loop if it keeps track of its percepts during execution. The term closed loop is used to <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/mean.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"85\" to=\"89\" origin-text=\"mean\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">mean</a> that the loop between the agent and its environment is not broken. A search problem is defined by the following five components: <br>The set of possible states (<a data-href=\"State Space\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">State Space</a>).\nThe initial state.\nA set of one or more goals states.\nThe set of actions available to the agent.\n<br>The <a data-href=\"Transition Model\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Transition Model</a>, which describes the result of the agent taking a action in its current state. A sequence of actions forms a path within the state space, and a path is considered a solution if it reaches a goal state from the initial state. A solution is considered optimal if it has the lowest cost among all possible solutions. <br>\nThe state space can be represented as a <a data-href=\"Graph\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Graph</a> where the vertices represent states, and edges represent actions which lead to other states. The diameter of a graph is the greatest distance between any 2 nodes. A state can be abstracted by removing as much detail as possible, while still retaining validity. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Search Algorithm\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Search Algorithm</a>: Takes a search problem and returns a solution or failure. There are four ways to evaluate the performance of a search algorithm: Completeness: Does the algorithm always find a solution if one exists?\nOptimality: Does the algorithm find the optimal solution?\n<br><a data-href=\"Time Complexity\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Time Complexity</a>: How does the search time scale as the size of the problem scales?\n<br><a data-href=\"Space Complexity\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Space Complexity</a>: How does the memory usage scale as the size of the problem scales? In bounded suboptimal search we look for a solution within some constant factor of the optimal solution. In bounded-cost search we look for a solution whose cost is less than some constant. In unbounded-cost search we accept any solution and prioritize the speed of the algorithm. For a search algorithm to be complete in an infinite state space, it needs to systematically explore the space. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Search Tree\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Search Tree</a>: Describes the path between states. The root node represents the initial state, and the current node can be expanded by considering the actions available, then generating a new child node for each resulting state. <br>\nFrontier: The collection of nodes that have been generated but not yet explored and is typically implemented as a <a data-href=\"Queue\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Queue</a> or a <a data-href=\"Stack\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Stack</a>. The functions available on the frontier are: is-Empty, which checks if the frontier is empty.\npop, which returns and removes the first element.\ntop, which returns the first element but does not remove it.\nadd, which adds a new element to the end of the queue. A best-first search, also known as a greedy search, chooses the node with the lowest cost in the frontier. A node is made up of the following four components: The state that it represents.\nIts parent node, which allows us to backtrack from a goal state back to the initial state.\nThe action which generated it.\nIts total path cost from the root. An uninformed search algorithm is completely unaware of how far any state is from the goal. Uninformed algorithms are differ in the way that they expand nodes in the frontier. Some common uninformed search algorithms include: <br><a data-href=\"Breadth-First Search\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Breadth-First Search</a>: Expands all the nodes in the current depth, starting at the root, before moving deeper into the tree. This search in implemented using a queue, which is a FIFO data structure. BFS is a systematic search, meaning, it is complete even in infinite state spaces.\nBFS is cost optimal if the edges are unweighted or have a global constant weight.\nThe goal test may be early, meaning each node is checked to be a goal when it is first generated; or the goal test may be late, meaning each node is checked when it is popped from the queue.\nThe time and space complexity of BFS is where is the number of children and is the depth of the tree. <br><a data-href=\"Dijkstra's Algorithm\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dijkstra's Algorithm</a>: is a greedy search algorithm that uses a late goal test to ensure optimality. It maintains a list of the shortest distances to each node from the root where, initially, the distance to the root is 0 and the distance to all other nodes is . The frontier is implemented as a priority queue, where the node with the smallest distance is expanded first. Then all the current node's neighbors are examined and if a shorter distance is found, the distance to the corresponding node is updated. This process is iterated until the optimal path is found. Dijkstra's is complete and optimal for weighted graphs with non-negative weights.\nThe time complexity of Dijkstra's is where is the number of vertices, and is the number of edges. The space complexity of Dijkstra's is . <br><a data-href=\"Depth-First Search\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Depth-First Search</a>: Expands the deepest node in the frontier. DFS uses a stack as opposed to a queue, which is a LIFO data structure. This algorithm is commonly implemented as a tree search, meaning, it doesn't keep track of the states that it has reached. DFS continues down a path until either a goal is found, or a leaf node is found. In the latter case, the algorithm backtracks to the next deepest node and expands its children if any. DFS is not cost-optimal. DFS is complete in finite state spaces though not in infinite state spaces.\nThe time complexity of DFS is and the space complexity is .\n<br><a data-href=\"Backtracking Search\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Backtracking Search</a> is a variation of DFS where only one successor is generated at a time, and the current state description is updated in place, rather than allocating memory for a new state. <br><a data-href=\"Depth-Limited Search\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Depth-Limited Search</a>: Treats nodes at depth as if they are leaf nodes. This prevents the node from traveling down an infinite path. <br>The time complexity of depth-limited search is where is the <a data-href=\"Branching Factor\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Branching Factor</a> and is the depth limit.\nThe diameter of the state space is a good limit value, though, it is rarely known beforehand. <br><a data-href=\"Iterative Deepening DFS\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Iterative Deepening DFS</a>: A depth limited search which iteratively increments the depth limit until a solution is found or a failure is returned. This combines the benefits of depth first and breadth first search. Optimal for unweighted paths.\nComplete for finite, acyclic state spaces.\nTime complexity of <br><a data-href=\"Bidirectional Search\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bidirectional Search</a>: Searches forward from the initial state and backward from the goal state until the 2 meet. The goal test returns true when the two paths meet. Since 2 frontiers need to be tracked, the space requirements are higher than most of the previously discussed algorithms. An informed (heuristic) search algorithm uses a heuristic function to estimate the distance of any given node from the goal. A search is considered greedy if it expands the node with the lowest always. Greedy searches are complete on finite spaces, but not on infinite spaces.\n<br><a data-href=\"A* Search\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">A* Search</a>: The evaluation function, , is the path cost from the current state to node plus . A* is complete and optimal if the heuristic is admissible or optimistic - meaning it never overestimates the cost to the goal.\nA* prunes nodes that are unnecessary for finding a solution.\nIf we allow A* to use an inadmissible heuristic, there is a risk of finding a suboptimal solution, but the heuristic may be more accurate, thus, reducing the number of expanded nodes.\nA variant of A, called **weighted A search** emphasizes the heuristic by multiplying by some constant . Weighted A finds a solution somewhere between and . A heuristic is consistent if for every node , its successor : , where represents the cost from to .\n<br>This means that the cost of reaching the goal from node is never greater than the cost of getting to from , plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal from . This is a version of the <a data-href=\"Triangle Inequality\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Triangle Inequality</a>.\nEvery consistent heuristic is admissible, but not every admissible heuristic is consistent.\nA composite heuristic combines multiple heuristics, and for certain complex problems, can be more effective than a single heuristic. A node is surely expanded if it can be reached from the initial state on a path where every node has , where is the optimal cost.\n<br><a data-href=\"Beam Search\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Beam Search</a>: Keeps track of only the nodes with the best f-scores. Is incomplete and suboptimal, but very fast and memory efficient. <br><a data-href=\"Iterative Deepening A*\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Iterative Deepening A*</a>: Combines the advantages of A* and iterative deepening DFS, where, at each iteration, the cutoff values is the smallest f-score of any node that exceeds the cutoff of the previous iteration. The initial cutoff is the heuristic value of the root node. <br>Can be visualized using <a data-href=\"Search Contours\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Search Contours</a>. <br><a data-href=\"Recursive Best-First Search\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Recursive Best-First Search</a>: Uses a f-limit variable to keep track of the f-value of the best alternative path from any ancestor of the current node. If the current node exceeds that f-limit, the recursion unwinds to the alternative path. Is optimal if the heuristic is admissible. Both RBFS and IDA use too little* memory, meaning they forget most of what they've done.\n<br><a data-href=\"Memory-Bounded A*\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Memory-Bounded A*</a>: And <a data-href=\"Simplified Memory-Bounded A*\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Simplified Memory-Bounded A*</a> uses all the memory that is allocated to it. SMA proceeds like A, expanding the node with the best f-score until memory is full. In that case, it drops the node with the highest f-score and passes its value to the parent, similar to RBFS. If all nodes have the same f-score, the oldest node is deleted and the newest is expanded.\nIs complete and optimal if the optimal solution can fit in memory. <br>\nOne way to analyze the quality of a heuristic is the <a data-href=\"Effective Branching Factor\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Effective Branching Factor</a> . <br>If is the total number of nodes generated by A and the solution depth is , $b^$ is the branching factor a <a data-href=\"Uniform Tree\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Uniform Tree</a> of depth must have to contain nodes. A well-designed heuristic should have a branching factor close to 1. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Relaxed Problems\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Relaxed Problems</a>: problems with fewer restrictions on available actions. For example, allowing illegal moves in the <a data-href=\"N-Queens Problem\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">N-Queens Problem</a>. The cost of an optimal solution in a relaxed problem is an admissible and consistent heuristic for the original problem.\nAdmissible heuristics can also be derived from subproblems of the original problem where the optimal cost in the subproblem is a lower bound on the cost of the complete problem. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Pattern Database\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Pattern Database</a>: Stores the exact solution costs for possible subproblem instances. Commonly used to store <a data-href=\"Endgame Tablebase\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Endgame Tablebase</a>s for an AI <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/projects/ai-chess-robot/chess-engine.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"12\" to=\"24\" origin-text=\"chess engine\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">chess engine</a>, for example. When searching for a solution, the agent can use the pattern database to quickly estimate the cost for a given state.\nDisjoint pattern databases ignore rather than abstract the rest of the problem. Pre-computation stores the optimal path between pairs of vertices. Landmark points can be precomputed and used as an efficient but inadmissible heuristic. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Metalevel State Space\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Metalevel State Space</a>: Allows an agent to reason about its own reasoning process by evaluating potential strategies and their outcomes. Metalevel state spaces allow an agent to learn from experience and dynamically adjust their strategy based on observed output. Local search algorithms search the state space without keeping track of a path or previously reached states. These algorithms are not systematic, though they use very little memory, and usually have constant space complexity.\nLocal search is good for problems where only the final state is desired and not so much the path to get there. The most common application of local search is solving optimization problems, where the goal is to find the best state according to some objective function. Consider the states of a problem laid out in a state-space landscape—a line chart where each state has an elevation defined by the objective function. <br>If the goal is to find the highest peak, then the problem is called <a data-href=\"Hill Climbing\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hill Climbing</a>.\n<br>If the goal is to find the lowest valley, the problem is called <a data-href=\"Gradient Descent\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gradient Descent</a>. Hill Climbing: An optimization algorithm which keeps track of the current state, and on each iteration, moves to the neighboring state which provides the steepest ascent, that is, it moves uphill. Hill climbing terminates when it reaches a peak, or local maximum, a point where no neighboring state has a higher value.\nSince it doesn't look ahead past it's immediate neighbors, nor does it consider more than the next move, hill climbing is considered a greedy local search.\nHill climbing is also susceptible to plateaus, a flat region of the state space landscape. A plateau is a shoulder if it immediately neighbors a better state. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Stochastic Hill Climbing\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Stochastic Hill Climbing</a>: Chooses randomly from the set of available uphill moves. Typically, the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Probability\" data-href=\"Probability\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/probability.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">probability</a> of a move being selected is linear to the steepness of the move. <br>\n<a data-href=\"First-Choice Hill Climbing\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">First-Choice Hill Climbing</a>: Randomly generates successors until a state better than the current one is generated. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Random-Restart Hill Climbing\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Random-Restart Hill Climbing</a>: Conducts a series of searches from random initial states, until a goal is found. Random-restart is complete, since it will eventually generate a goal as the initial state.\nIf each search has a probability of success, the expected number of restarts is . <br>\n<a data-href=\"Simulated Annealing\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Simulated Annealing</a>: A local search algorithm with a temperature which determines the <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/probability.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"22\" to=\"33\" origin-text=\"probability\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">probability</a> of the algorithm accepting a downhill move. The algorithms starts with a high temperature, which decreases over iterations. The probability of a move being selected decreases with the \"badness\" of the move.\nSince simulated annealing can make downhill moves, this allows it to escape local maxima that other algorithms can't. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Local Beam Search\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Local Beam Search</a>: A local search algorithm which keeps track of states rather than just one. It begins with randomly generated states, and at each iteration, generates all the neighbors of all states. If one of the successors is a goal state, then the algorithm halts; else, the algorithm selects the best successors and repeats. A variant of local beam search, called stochastic beam search, chooses successors with probabilities proportional to their values. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Genetic Algorithms\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Genetic Algorithms</a>: A variant of local beam search inspired by the principles of natural selection and genetics. Successor states are generated by a process called recombination, where two parent states are combined to make a new state. One approach to recombination is to randomly select a crossover point, which splits each of the parent strings and recombines them to form a child. Genetic algorithms starts with a \"population\" of states, where each state is evaluated based on its fitness level, which determines the likelihood of that state being selected for reproduction. The mutation rate determines the probability that each bit in the offspring string is flipped. This ensures diversity in the population. Elitism is where a number of high-scoring individuals from the previous generation are propagated forward into the current generation without modification. This ensures that high-quality solutions are preserved while still maintaining diversity. Culling is where individuals performing under a certain threshold are removed from the population. Schema: A substring where some positions are left unspecified. Schemas can be thought of as templates or patterns for a full solution. Genetic algorithms work best when schemas correspond to meaningful components of a solution. Continuous Space: A state space with an infinite branching factor. Most real-world environments are continuous. You can discretize a continuous space be limiting values to fixed intervals.\nAlternatively, you can make the branching factor finite by sampling successor states randomly, in a random direction by some small amount . <br>\n<a data-href=\"Gradient\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gradient</a>: A <a data-href=\"Vector\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Vector</a> that contains all the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Partial Derivative\" data-href=\"Partial Derivative\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">partial derivatives</a> of a function. Empirical Gradient: The gradient of a function based on observed data rather than analytical calculation. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Line Search\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Line Search</a>: An optimization technique that is used to find a satisfactory step size along a specific direction to minimize a function. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Newton-Raphson Algorithm\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Newton-Raphson Algorithm</a>: A general method for finding roots of functions, that is, solutions to equations of the form . Constrained Optimization Problem: An optimization problem where solutions must satisfy some constraints on the value of variables. <br>The most well-known category of constrained optimization problems are <a data-href=\"Linear Programming\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Linear Programming</a> problems.\n<br>Linear programming is a case of the more general problem of <a data-href=\"Convex Optimization\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Convex Optimization</a>. Search with Nondeterministic Actions: When the environment is partially-observable or is nondeterministic, the agent either doesn't exactly know it's current state (sensor model), or the next state (transition model) respectively. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Belief State\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Belief State</a>: The set of states that the agent believes it could be in. In nondeterministic or partially-observable environments, the solution to a problem is a conditional plan rather than a sequence of actions. The action to take is conditionally dependent on the percepts received. In a nondeterministic environment, the transition model returns a set of possible states, rather than a single state. The conditional plan can contain if-else statements, which allows solutions to be represented as trees rather than sequences. In a deterministic environment, the only branching is introduced by the agent's actions. These are called 'or' nodes. In a non-deterministic environment, branching is also introduced by the environments choice of outcome for each action. These are called 'and' nodes. <br>\nThese two nodes alternate to create an <a data-href=\"And-Or Tree\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">And-Or Tree</a>. A solution for an and-or search problem is a subtree where: Every leaf is a goal node.\nSpecifies an action at each OR node.\nIncludes each outcome of each AND node. And-or graphs can be explored using breadth-first or depth-first search. Cycles can arise in nondeterministic problems, one case is where an action has no effect on the current state. If an agent is in an environment where actions can fail, there are no acyclic solutions.\nOne workaround is to use a while construct, where an action is repeated until it succeeds. This is only useful if repeating the action increases the probability that it succeeds. Sensorless Problems: A problem where an agent's percepts provide no information on the state of the environment. The solution to sensorless problems is a sequence of actions, not a conditional plan, since there are no possible percepts to condition on.\nIf problem has states, the belief-state problem has states.\nThe initial state is typically all the states of .\nIf the agent is unsure about what state it is in, and if some actions are only legal in particular states, then the agent is unsure about what actions it can legally perform. If illegal actions have no consequence on the environment, then the agent can take the union of all actions. Though, if performing illegal actions can be detrimental, then it is safer to take the intersection of available actions.\nThe transition model for belief states results in a new belief state with all the possible results of the action for each state in the current belief state.\nThe agent is possibly in a goal state if the current belief state contains a goal state. The agent is necessarily in a goal state if every state in the current belief state is a goal state.\nThe path cost could be one of several values if the same action has different costs in different states.\nIn ordinary graph search, newly reached states are tested to see if they've been visited previously, this can be done for belief states as well. If the current belief state is a superset of a previous belief state, we can discard the superset belief state since a solution to the superset must be a solution for each state in the corresponding subset.\nAdditionally, if the superset has been proven to be solvable, then any of its subsets are guaranteed to be solvable. This extra level of pruning can dramatically increase the efficiency of sensorless solutions. Though, even with this pruning, sensorless problems are still too vast to be solved efficiently.\nOne alternative is to avoid standard search algorithms, and use algorithms that look within belief states and develop incremental belief-state search algorithms. Partially Observable Problems: Problems where the agent has a PERCEPTS function which returns the percept received by the agent's sensors in a given state. If sensing is nondeterministic, the PERCEPTS function can return a set of possible percepts.\nWith partial observability, many states can produce the same percepts.\nThe two main differences between agents in partially observable environments and fully observable deterministic environments is: The solution is a conditional plan rather than a sequence.\nThe agent needs to maintain a belief state. Online Search: A search algorithm which interleaves action and planning. This is useful in dynamic or semi-dynamic environments, where the environment can change while the agent is deliberating. Online search is also useful in nondeterministic environments by focusing on contingencies which actually occur, rather than the set of all possible contingencies.\nThe competitive ratio is the discovered solution cost to the optimal cost if the environment was known.\nOnline agents can get stuck in dead-ends, states from which no goal is reachable.\n<br>One common example of online search are <a data-href=\"Simultaneous Localization and Mapping\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Simultaneous Localization and Mapping</a> or SLAM problems, where an agent must build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of its position within that environment.\nAn offline algorithm explores a model of the state space, while an online algorithm explores the real world. Therefore, an online algorithm can only discover successors for the state it is currently in, while offline algorithms can jump around the state space.\nIn an online DFS, when an agent has tried all the actions in a given state, it must backtrack in the physical world. This can be done by keeping track of the predecessor states of the current state. Though this only works if the actions in the state-space are reversible. Online Local Search: Algorithms like hill climbing or gradient descent are already considered online algorithms. Though, these algorithms are not as good for exploration due to getting stuck at local maxima/minima. A random walk simply selects one of the actions available at random. Preference can be given to actions that have yet to be tried.\nHill climbing can be augmented with memory, where a heuristic value is stored for each visited state.\nOptimism under uncertainty encourages the agent to explore new paths, rather than go down already explored paths.\n<br><a data-href=\"Learning Real-Time A*\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Learning Real-Time A*</a>* updates the cost element for the state it just left, then chooses the best move according to it's current cost element. Factored Representation: A way of representing states as a set of variables that each have a value. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Constraint Satisfaction Problem\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Constraint Satisfaction Problem</a>: Specifies constraints on the values of variables of a state. The solutions is the set of states where each variable satisfies every constraint on it. A CSP has three components: : The set of variables.\n: The set of domains, one for each variable. A domain can be discrete, continuous, finite, or infinite.\n: The set of constraints. Each constraint is a pair , where is a tuple of variables and is a relationship defining the values that each in-scope variable can take on. A relationship may be written as an explicit set of tuples, or as a function.\nA unary constraint deals with one variable, a binary constraint deals with two. A constraint that deals with more than two variables is called a global constraint, even if it doesn't involve all variables.\nPrecedence constraints assert that one task must be complete before another.\nDisjunctive constraints allow a disjunction of conditions to satisfy the constraint.\n<br>Preference constraints are encoded as costs on variable assignments. CSPs with preferences can be solved using path-based or local optimization search algorithms. Such a problem is called a <a data-href=\"Constraint Optimization Problem\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Constraint Optimization Problem</a>.\nWith infinite domains, you must use implicit constraints.\n<br><a data-href=\"Linear Programming\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Linear Programming</a> problems are an example of CSPs in continuous domains, since each constraint is a linear equality/inequality. An assignment which satisfies all constraints is consistent or legal. An assignment is complete if it assigns a value to each variable.\nA solution is a legal and complete assignment. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Constraint Graph\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Constraint Graph</a>: A data structure in which nodes correspond to state variables, and edges correspond to binary constraints between variables. Constraint Hypergraph: Consists of nodes (circles) and square nodes—hypernodes that represent -ary constraints involving variables. Auxiliary Variables: A temporary variable used to simplify problems or represent certain constraints. Constraint Propagation: Uses the constraints on variables to reduce the legal values for variables, which could reduce the domains of other variables, and so on. Enforcing local consistency on nodes in a constraint graph causes inconsistent values to be eliminated throughout the graph. Node Consistency: A variable is node-consistent if all the values in its domain satisfies all the unary constraints on out.\nArc Consistency: A variable is arc-consistent if every value in its domain satisfies all binary constraints it's a part of. <br>\n<a data-href=\"AC-3\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">AC-3</a>: The most popular arc-consistency algorithm which maintains a queue of arcs to consider. AC-3 pops an arc from the queue, (), and makes arc-consistent with respect to .\nIf the domain of , remains the same, it moves on to the next arc.\nIf the domain of changes, then all arcs are enqueued, where is a neighbor of .\nThe complexity is where is the number of arcs and is the maximum size of the domain. Path Consistency: A set of variables are path consistent if, for every assignment to and consistent with their constraints, there is an assignment to that satisfies constraints on () and (). This refers to the overall consistency of the path from to through a third variable . -Consistency: A CSP is -consistent if, for any set of variables, and for any consistent assignment to those variables, a consistent value can be assigned to any th variable. Arc-consistency is considered 2-consistent.\nA CSP is strongly -consistent if it is -consistent, -consistent, all the way to 1-consistent. The alldiff constraint says that all in-scope variables must have distinct values. The resource constraint, also called the at-most constraint, is a limitation on the availability of a particular resource. <br>\nFor large problems, it is common to represent domains using upper and lower bounds. These domains are managed by <a data-href=\"Bounds Propagation\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bounds Propagation</a>. A CSP is bounds-consistent if, for every variable , the lower and upper bounds of have corresponding values in the domain of every variable such that the constraints on and are satisfied. This means that for each value within the bounds of , there exists at least one compatible value in the domain of that meets the constraints. <br>\nFor a CSP with variables, the tree representing the CSP has leaves even though there are only possible complete assignments. We can reduce this by a factor of if we recognize that CSPs are <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Commutative Property\" data-href=\"Commutative Property\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/commutative-property.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">commutative</a>. Commutativity means that the order of application of a set of actions does not matter. With this restriction, the number of leaves is . <br>\n<a data-href=\"Backtracking Search\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Backtracking Search</a>: A depth-first search for CSPs is used when after performing constraint propagation, there are still multiple possible values for variables. A recursive backtracking search chooses an unassigned variable, then chooses a value for that variable which satisfies all the constraints on the variable. If the call assigns a value to all variables successfully, then a solution is returned. If a variable's domain becomes empty, then the call backtracks by undoing the last assignment and tries another legal value.\nThe simplest strategy for selecting an unassigned variable is called static ordering. This strategy simply chooses the variables in the order that they appear in. The next simplest strategy is choosing randomly. Neither of these are optimal.\nMinimum-Remaining-Values Heuristic: Chooses the variable with the least amount of values in its domain. If some variable has no legal values left, the MRV heuristic will recognize this immediately and start backtracking.\nDegree Heuristic: Chooses the variable that is involved in the largest number of constraints with other unassigned variables. This is typically used as a tiebreaker for the MRV heuristic.\nLeast-Constraining-Value Heuristic: Chooses the value in the current variables domain which rules out the fewest choices for neighboring values in the constraint graph. Forward Checking: A form of inference where whenever a variable is assigned a value, the forward-checking process establishes arc-consistency for it. For each unassigned neighbor of , delete any values from its domain that is inconsistent with the value chosen for .\nFor many problems, the search is more efficient if the MRV heuristic and forward-checking are combined.\nForward-checking is not a complete method for discovering inconsistencies. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Maintaining Arc-Consistency\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maintaining Arc-Consistency</a>: An algorithm that can detect more inconsistencies than forward checking. It creates a queue of all arcs in the CSP, then pops one ().\nFor each value in 's domain, check if there exists a value in that satisfies the constraint. If not, remove the value from 's domain.\nIf the domain of changes, add all arcs that are connected to back in the queue. Chronological Backtracking: A backtracking method which backtracks to the previous assigned variable and tries a new value for it. This is not an intelligent way to backtrack. A better way is to backtrack to variables that are more likely to fix the problem. One way to do so is to keep a conflict set—a set of assignments that are in conflict with some value of the current variable.\n<br>The <a data-href=\"Backjumping Method\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Backjumping Method</a> moves back to the most recent assignment in the conflict set. Forward checking can be modified to supply a conflict set.\n<br><a data-href=\"Conflict-Directed Backjumping\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Conflict-Directed Backjumping</a>: The conflict set for a variable is the set of preceding variables that cause to current variable to fail, together with any subsequent failed variables. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Constraint Learning\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Constraint Learning</a>: The process of learning and adding new constraints whenever an inconsistency is detected. It involve finding the minimum set of variables from the conflict set which causes the inconsistency. Local Search For CSPs: Local search algorithms can be effective for solving CSPs. A complete state formulation is used, meaning each state assigns a value to every variable and the search changes the value of one variable at a time. The landscape of a CSP using the min-conflicts heuristic usually has a series of plateaus. Plateau search allows sideways movements across plateaus which helps avoid getting stuck at local maxima.\nTabu search can avoid wandering back and forth on a plateau by keeping a list of recently visited states and forbidding the algorithm to return to such states. Constraint Weighing: Assigns weights to constraints based on their importance. All constraints are initiated with a weight of 1, and each time a constraint is violated, its weight is incremented. This adds topography to plateaus, and it adds a form of machine learning. Independent Subproblem: A subset of variables and constraints in a CSP which can be solved without considering the rest of the problem. Independence can be discovered by finding independent components in the constraint graph. Though, comp\nIndependent subproblems can be solved in time linear in , the number of variables. Without this decomposition into subproblems, the work required is exponential in . Though, fully independent subproblems are rare in practice. There are constraint graph structures other than independent subproblems which are easy to solve. A constraint graph is a tree when any two variables are connected by only one path. Tree-structured CSPs can also be solved in linear time using directional arc-consistency. A CSP is DAC if under an ordering of variables , every is arc-consistent with every where .\nTo solve a tree-structured CSP, pick any variable as the root of the tree, then choose an ordering such that each variable appears after its parent in the tree. This is called a topological sort. Once you have a DAC graph, you can simply go down the list of variables and choose any remaining values. A constraint graph can be reduced to a tree by fixing the values of some variables, such that the remaining unassigned variables form a tree. A cycle cutset is a set of edges whose removal would disconnect the graph or eliminate cycles. There are approximation algorithms for finding the smallest cycle cutset. Tree Decomposition: Another technique for reducing a constraint graph to a tree. It is a transformation in which each node of the resulting tree consists of a set of variables from the original graph. A tree decomposition must satisfy three requirements: Every variable appears in at least one tree node.\nIf two variables have an edge between them, both variables and their constraint must appear in at least one tree node.\nIf a variable appears in two nodes, it must appear in each node along the path connecting those nodes. Value Symmetry: The situation where distinct values of a variable's domain lead to the same solution. You can reduce the search space by a factor of by breaking up symmetry in the assignments. This is achieved using symmetry breaking constraints. For example, you can enforce the values of three variables to be in alphabetical order, allowing only one solution. <br>\nCompetitive Environment: A multi-agent environment in which agents have conflicting goals. This results in <a data-href=\"Adversarial Search Problems\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Adversarial Search Problems</a>. In the case where there is a large number of agents, we can consider them in the aggregate as an economy, allowing us to make predictions without considering the actions of each individual agent.\nWe can also model adversaries as a stochastic part of the environment itself.\n<br>A third option is to model the adversarial agents explicitly with the techniques of <a data-href=\"Adversarial Game Search Tree\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Adversarial Game Search Tree</a>. Pruning is the process of ignoring certain parts of the search tree that don't impact the optimal move.\nA heuristic evaluation function estimates who is winning in each state based on the features of the state. An agent has imperfect information if it doesn't have complete knowledge about the environment. Imperfect information is also called partial observability, where perfect information is called full observability. <br>\nChess is a two-player, deterministic, turn-taking, perfect-information, <a data-href=\"Zero-Sum\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zero-Sum</a> game. In multi-agent environments, actions are called moves and states are called positions.\nA zero-sum game is a game where the sum of the payoffs to all players equals 0. Meaning whatever one player gains is directly cancelled out by the loss of another player. A game can be formally defined with the following components: : The initial state of the game.\nTO-MOVE(s): A function that returns the player whose turn it is in state .\nACTION(s): Returns the set of legal actions in state .\nRESULT(s, a): The transition model defining the result of action in state .\nIS-TERMINAL(s): Returns true if state is a terminal state, meaning the game is over.\nUTILITY(s,p): A utility function defining the utility value to player when the game ends in terminal state . <br>\n<a data-href=\"State-Space Graph\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">State-Space Graph</a>: Defined by the initial state, actions, and result function. Nodes represents positions (states), and edges represent moves. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Game-Tree\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Game-Tree</a>: A specialized form of a state-space graph, it assumes a two-player turn-taking game. One player is designated the MAX player, who is trying to maximize the objective function; the other player is the MIN player, who is trying to minimize the objective function.\nA ply refers to a single move made by a single agent. <br>\nFor an agent to act rationally, its <a data-href=\"Strategy\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Strategy</a> must be conditioned upon the actions of the other player. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Minimax Algorithm\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Minimax Algorithm</a>: Given a game tree, the optimal move can be determined by working out the minimax value of each state, denoted as MINIMAX(s). MAX prefers a higher value, while MIN prefers a lower value.\n<br>The algorithm performs a complete <a data-href=\"Recursive\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Recursive</a> <a data-href=\"Depth-First Search\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Depth-First Search</a> exploration. It proceeds down to a leaf node, and backs up the minimax value through the tree as the recursion unwinds.\nThe complexity of minimax by itself is where is the branching factor of the tree and is the max depth of the tree. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Alpha-Beta Pruning\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Alpha-Beta Pruning</a>: An optimization technique used in the minimax algorithm which prunes suboptimal branches. It keeps track of two values: Alpha: The highest-value choice found so-far along the path for the MAX player.\nBeta: The lowest-value choice found so-far along the path for the MIN player.\nIf MAX's score exceeds MIN's beta value, the branch is beta-pruned.\nIf MIN's score is less than MAX's alpha value, the branch is alpha-pruned. The effectiveness of alpha-beta pruning is dependent on the order in which states are examined. If we could first examine the best states, minimax with pruning would reduce to . This is in the case of perfect move ordering. If the best moves are evaluated first, the alpha and beta values can be updated more quickly. This allows for more effective pruning of suboptimal branches. Using heuristics can lead to better move orderings. For example, moves that capture pieces or attack the king can be examined first, in the case of a chess game.\nKiller moves are moves that have caused pruning in previous searches. Prioritizing these moves is called the killer moves heuristic. Repeated states may occur in a game tree due to transpositions, which are different permutations of the same move sequence leading to the same position. <br>Transpositions are addressed using <a data-href=\"Transposition Tables\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Transposition Tables</a>. Say two move sequences, and both lead to the same state . We can find the value of state when exploring sequence and store it in the transposition table. Then, when we reach state from sequence , we can simply look up its value in the table. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Type A Strategy\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Type A Strategy</a>: Evaluates all possible moves to a certain depth in the game tree and uses a heuristic function to estimate the utility of states at that depth. This cuts the search off early and applies a heuristic function to states, effectively treating non-terminal states as terminal.\nIn this case, you replace the utility function with an EVAL function, and the terminal test function is replaced with a cutoff test, which returns true for terminal nodes, but is otherwise free to decide when to cut off a search. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Type B Strategy\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Type B Strategy</a>: Ignores moves that look bad, and follows promising lines as far as possible. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Heuristic Evaluation Function\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Heuristic Evaluation Function</a>: Returns an estimate of the expected utility of a state to player . For terminal states, EVAL(s,p) must equal UTILITY(s,p). For non-terminal states, the evaluation must be between a loss and a win.\nMost evaluations work by calculating various features of states. The features taken together define various categories or equivalence classes of states. This enables the evaluation function to return a single variable which estimated the proportion of states with each outcome in that equivalence class.\n<br>A weighted linear function computes separate contributions from each feature, and combines them for the total value. It's defined as: . The weights should be normalized so that the sum is always within the <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/range.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"59\" to=\"64\" origin-text=\"range\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">range</a> . <br>\nCutting-Off: The most straightforward approach to cutting the search early. This method sets a fixed depth limit as the cutoff point. This is called a <a data-href=\"Depth-Limited Search\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Depth-Limited Search</a>. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Iterative Deepening\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Iterative Deepening</a>: Iteratively performs depth-limited searches, incrementing the depth limit on each iteration. The evaluation function should only apply to positions that are quiescent or stable, meaning there is no pending move that would drastically change the evaluation. <br>The IS-CUTOFF function should return false for non-quiescent states. This is called a <a data-href=\"Quiescent Search\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Quiescent Search</a>. Horizon Effect: Occurs when the agent is facing a devastating move from the opponent, but can delay it beyond its horizon by performing other moves. <br>One way to address this is to allow <a data-href=\"Singular Extensions\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Singular Extensions</a>, which are moves that are clearly better than all other available moves in a given position. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Forward Pruning\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Forward Pruning</a>: Prunes moves that appear to be poor moves, but might in fact be good. This saves computation time by incurring the risk of pruning good moves and is considered a type B strategy.\n<br>One approach, called <a data-href=\"Beam Search\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Beam Search</a>, on each ply, considers only the beam of the best moves according to the evaluation function.\nProbabilistic Cut Algorithm: A forward-pruning approach to alpha-beta search that uses statistics derived from previous experience to lessen the chance that the optimal move gets pruned. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Late Move Reduction\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Late Move Reduction</a> assumes that move ordering has been done well, therefore, moves that are later in the sequence are less likely to be good moves. Rather than pruning the late moves, we just reduce the depth at which they are searched. If the shallow search returns a value above the current alpha, the search is re-run at full depth. Table Lookup: Rather than search, table lookup stores and retrieves the best move from a data structure. A program can then produce a policy, which is a mapping from every possible state to the optimal move in that state. <br>This is commonly used in chess engines to save <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Endgame Tablebase\" data-href=\"Endgame Tablebase\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Endgame Tablebases</a>, which allows the engine to play endgames perfectly. This table is constructed with a <a data-href=\"Retrograde Minimax Search\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Retrograde Minimax Search</a>, which involves evaluating the end of the game backward to the beginning. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Monte-Carlo Tree Search\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Monte-Carlo Tree Search</a>: A search algorithm that doesn't use a heuristic evaluation function, instead it calculates the average utility over a number of complete games starting from a given state. This is the same as the win percentage for games with binary win/lose outcomes MCTS is considered a kind of <a data-href=\"Reinforcement Learning\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Reinforcement Learning</a>. Playout Policy: chooses which moves to make during a play-out simulation. These policies can be learned by self-play using neural networks.\nEarly playout termination is when a playout is stopped early because it is taking too many moves. The playout is either evaluated with a heuristic or is declared a draw.\n<br>A pure MCTS does simulations starting from the current state and tracks which possible moves have the highest win percentage. For some stochastic games, this converges to optimal play as increases, though it isn't sufficient for most games. We instead need a selection policy which balances the <a data-href=\"Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff</a>.\nMCTS does this by maintaining a search tree and growing it at each iteration of the following four steps: Selection: Starting at the root, we choose a move (according to the selection policy), leading to a successor state, and repeat this process to a leaf node.\nExpansion: We grow the tree by generating a new child of the selected node.\nSimulation: We perform a playout from the newly generated node, choosing moves according to the playout policy.\nBack-Propagation: We use the result of the simulation to update all nodes going up to the root. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Upper Confidence Bound\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Upper Confidence Bound</a>: A selection policy which ranks possible moves according to the UCB formula: Where is the average reward obtained from action , is the total number of trials, is the total number of trials where action was selected, and is a constant which controls the degree of exploration. Stochastic Games: A class of games which are in an environment that exhibit randomness. A standard game tree cannot be used to model stochastic game because of their inherit uncertainty. <br>Chance nodes are included which denote the possible outcomes of some random variable and their <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Probability\" data-href=\"Probability\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/probability.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">probabilities</a>.\n<br>Positions do not have definite MINIMAX values, an <a data-href=\"Expected Value\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Expected Value</a> is calculated instead. This leads to the expectminimax values for games with chance nodes. Knowledge-Based Agent: Uses reasoning processes over an internal knowledge representation. The central component of a knowledge-based agent is its knowledge base (KB). <br>\n<a data-href=\"Knowledge Base\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Knowledge Base</a>: A set of sentences, each expressed in a knowledge representation language and represents some assertion about the world. When the sentence isn't derived from other sentences, it is called an axiom.\nA KB may initially contain some background knowledge. TELL and ASK are the names for adding to or querying the KB, respectively. Each of these operations may include inference: deriving new sentences from existing ones. Each time a knowledge-based agent is called it: TELLs the KB what it saw (its percepts).\nASKs the KB what action to perform. This usually requires extensive reasoning.\nTELLs the KB what action was chosen and returns that action. Declarative Approach: Starts with an empty KB, and the agent designer TELLs sentences one by one until the agent can operate in its environment. Procedural Approach: Encodes desired behavior directly as program code. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Logic\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Logic</a>: A formal system that uses symbols and syntax to represent logical expressions and arguments. A logic must also define the semantics, or meaning, of sentences. The semantics defines the truth of each sentence with respect to each possible world.\nThe term model is commonly used in place of possible world. When possible worlds represent potentially real environments, a model is a mathematical abstraction, which has a fixed truth value for every relevant sentence. Logical entailment between two sentences means that a sentence follows logically from another sentence. Entailment is represented symbolically as . This means entails if and only if, in every model where is true, is also true. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Logical Inference\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Logical Inference</a>: The process of deriving new conclusions from existing premises. Model Checking: Enumerating all possible models to check if is true in all models where the KB is true. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Inference Algorithm\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Inference Algorithm</a>: A computational method which derives entailed sentences based on a KB. IF a inference algorithm derives only entailed sentences, it is sound or truth preserving. If it derives all entailed sentences, it is complete. If some inference algorithm can derive from KB, it is said that \" is derived from KB by \". This sentence is represented symbolically as: Grounding: The connection between logical reasoning processes and the real environment. The agent's sensors create this connection and the general rules of this environment are produced by a sentence construction process called learning. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Propositional Logic\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/propositional-logic.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Propositional Logic</a>: A branch of <a data-href=\"Logic\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Logic</a> that deals with propositions, which are statements that are either true or false. <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/propositional-logic.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"2\" to=\"21\" origin-text=\"Propositional logic\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">Propositional logic</a> is made up of: Propositional Symbols: Symbols that start with an uppercase letter and refer to a proposition. For example, , , and are examples of propositional symbols. Each symbol represents a distinct statement that can be true or false. Individual symbols are commonly referred to as literals. A literal is negative if there is a negation applied to it (e.g. ), else, it's a positive literal. Logical Connectives: Operators which combine propositional symbols to create complex sentences. The common connectives include: Negation (NOT, ¬)\nConjunction (AND, ∧)\nDisjunction (OR, ∨)\nImplication (IMPLIES, →)\nBiconditional (IF AND ONLY IF, ↔)\nXOR (EXCLUSIVE OR, ) Atomic Sentence: An atomic sentence consists of a single propositional symbol and represents a basic assertion. Complex Sentence: A complex sentence is made up of propositional symbols connected by parenthesis and logical connectives. They are also called formulas. In propositional logic, a model is simply a setting of truth values for each propositional symbol. There are possible models, where is the number of propositional symbols. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Truth Table\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Truth Table</a>: species the truth value of sentences for each possible assignment of truth values for symbols. <br>\nPropositional logic is <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Monotonicity\" data-href=\"Monotonicity\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Monotonic</a>, meaning that when you add knowledge to a propositional <a data-href=\"Knowledge Base\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Knowledge Base</a>, it cannot lead to the loss of previously established truths. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Theorem Proving\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Theorem Proving</a>: Applying rules of inference to sentences in a KB to construct a proof of a sentence without checking models. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Rules of Inference\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rules of Inference</a>: Logical rules which provide the structure for how new statements can be derived from existing ones. Proofs: In propositional logic, proofs are essential for establishing the truth of a statement or the validity of an argument. A proof is a demonstration that a conclusion follows from a set of premises. Any of the ch.3 search algorithms can be used to find a sequence of steps to constitute a proof. We define a proof as the following components: Initial State: The initial KB.\n<br>Actions: The set of all the inference rules applied to all the sentences that match the top half of the inference rule. The top half refers to the numerator of the inference rule in <a data-href=\"Gentzen Notation\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gentzen Notation</a>.\nResult: The bottom half of the inference rule, or the denominator of the inference rule in Gentzen notation.\nGoal: A state that contains the sentence which we are trying to prove. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Modus Ponens\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Modus Ponens</a>: Modus Ponens is a syllogistic argument form and rule of inference. It has the following structure: If then .\n.\nTherefore, . <br>\nLogical Equivalence: Two sentences are said to be logically equivalent if they have the same truth table. This is denoted using the symbol. A <a data-href=\"Rule of Replacement\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rule of Replacement</a> is a logical principle that allows for the substitution of one logical expression, for another, logically equivalent expression. Rules of replacement are used to construct proofs, simply logical expressions, and verify the correctness of logical statements. <br>\nValidity: A sentence is valid if it is true in all models. This is called a <a data-href=\"Tautology\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tautology</a>, meaning that the sentence is necessarily true. Satisfiability: A formula is satisfiable if there is at least one assignment of truth values which makes the formula true. If there is no assignment of truth values to make the formula true, then it is unsatisfiable, also called a contradiction. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Proof by Contradiction\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Proof by Contradiction</a>: An indirect proof that assumes the conclusion is false, then proves that this assumption leads to a contradiction. If assuming the conclusion is false does lead to a contradiction, then the conclusion must be true. A clause is a disjunction/conjunction of literals. When talking about clauses, usually it refers to a disjunctive clause, which is a logical expression formed by connecting literals with the OR operator. The empty clause is a clause with no literals, commonly denoted as , , or . An empty disjunctive clause is always false, making it analogous to a contradiction. This is an important concept in proof by contradiction, as reaching an empty clause indicates that a contradiction has been proven. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Horn Clause\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Horn Clause</a>: A disjunctive clause with at most one positive literal. Definite Clause: If a Horn clause has exactly one positive literal, it is a definite clause. For example, .\nGoal Clause: If it has no positive literals, it is a goal clause. For example, .\n<br>Horn clauses are computationally efficient for algorithms such as <a data-href=\"Resolution Theorem Proving\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Resolution Theorem Proving</a>, or for <a data-href=\"Forward/Backward Chaining\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Forward/Backward Chaining</a>. This makes them the basis of many <a data-href=\"Logic Programming\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Logic Programming</a> languages, as well as for automated theorem proving or database querying. <br>\nProof by <a data-href=\"Resolution\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Resolution</a>: Resolution resolves two clauses which contain complementary literals. Two literals are complements of one another if one is the negation of the other (e.g. and ). Resolution is defined: The above example resolves and resulting in a new clause called the resolvent. Only one pair of complementary literals can be resolved at a time.\n<br>In the context of <a data-href=\"Automated Theorem Proving\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Automated Theorem Proving</a>, resolution is applied repeatedly to derive a contradiction, thereby proving that the negation of the statement that's being proven, is unsatisfiable. Resolution closure of a set of clauses is the set of all clauses derivable by repeated application of the resolution rule to clauses in or their derivatives.\n<br>The completeness theorem for resolution in <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Propositional Logic\" data-href=\"Propositional Logic\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/propositional-logic.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">propositional logic</a> is called the ground resolution theorem. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Conjunctive Normal Form\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Conjunctive Normal Form</a>: A sentence is considered to be in conjunctive normal form (CNF) if it's a conjunction (AND) of one or more clauses. A -CNF sentence is a CNF sentence where each clause has at most literals. If a KB contains only definite clauses: Every definite clause can be written as an implication whose premise is a conjunction of positive literals and whose conclusion is a single positive literal. Ex: .\nIn Horn form, the premise is called the body and the conclusion is called the head. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Forward Chaining\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Forward Chaining</a>: An algorithm which determines if a single propositional symbol (the query), is entailed by a knowledge base of definite clauses. It starts with known facts (single, positive literals), if all the premises of an implication are known, then its conclusion is added to the set of known facts.\nThis process continues until the query is added, or until no further inferences is made.\nForward chaining runs in linear time, is sound, and complete. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Backward Chaining\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Backward Chaining</a>: Works backwards from the query. If is known to be true then no work is needed. Else, the implications in the KB whose conclusion is are found.\nIf all the premises of one of those implications is known to be true, then is true.\nOften runs in sublinear time.

Like <a data-href=\"Backtracking Search\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Backtracking Search</a>, it is essentially a depth-first enumeration of possible models. Early termination occurs if the algorithm detects that the sentence must be true or false, even with a partially completed model. For example, a clause is true if any literal is true.\nPure Symbol Heuristic: A pure symbol is a symbol that always appears with the same sign in all clauses. If a sentence has a model, then it has a model with the pure symbols assigned so as to make their literals true, because doing so never makes a clause false.\nUnit Clause Heuristic: In the context of DPLL, a unit clause also means a clause in which all but one literal are already assigned false by the model. Unit propagation occurs when a unit's truth value leads to the simplification of other clauses by removing the occurrence of the literal. Hill-Climbing can be assigned to satisfiability (SAT) problems, provided a correct evaluation function is selected. Since the goal is to find an assignment that satisfies every clause, an evaluation function that counts the number of unsatisfied clauses works well. <br>\n<a data-href=\"WalkSAT Algorithm\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">WalkSAT Algorithm</a>: A local search algorithm which, on every iteration, picks an unsatisfied clause and picks a symbol to flip. The symbol that is picked is the one that minimizes the number of unsatisfied clauses in the new state. A fluent variable is an aspect of the world that changes. An atemporal variable is static. Hybrid Agent maintains and updates a KB as well as a current plan. The initial KB contains the atemporal variables. At each time step , the new percept sequence is added, along with all the fluent axioms, such as the successor state axioms.\nThe agent then uses logical inference to to derive new knowledge and update its knowledge base (KB).\nThough, with this program, as increases, the computational expense to logically infer increases due to inferences having to go further back and involve more propositional symbols. <br>One solution is to save or cache the results of inference. This is a form of <a data-href=\"Dynamic Programming\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dynamic Programming</a>. <br>\nThe percept history and all their ramifications can be replaced with the <a data-href=\"Belief State\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Belief State</a>, which is the set of all possible states of the world currently.

Programming languages are the largest class of formal languages in common use. The main drawback of programming languages is that they lack a general mechanism for deriving facts from other facts. In a compositional language, the meaning of a sentence is a function of its parts. <br>\n<a data-href=\"First-Order Logic\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/first-order-logic.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">First-Order Logic</a>: Extends <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/propositional-logic.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"10\" to=\"29\" origin-text=\"propositional logic\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">propositional logic</a> by introducing quantifiers and predicates, allowing for the representation of the relationships between objects.

Propositional logic assumes that facts are either true or false in the world. First-order logic assumes that the world consists of objects with relations that are either true or false.\nIn fuzzy logic, the ontological commitment allows degrees of truth between 0 and 1.\n<br><a data-href=\"Temporal Logic\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Temporal Logic</a> assumes that facts hold at particular times, and that those times are ordered.\nHigher-order logics view the relations and functions of first-order logic as objects themselves. A logic can also be characterized by its epistemological commitments, that is, the possible states of knowledge that it allows with respect to each fact. Both first-order and propositional logic sentences are either true, false, or unknown.\n<br>Systems using <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/probability.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"14\" to=\"25\" origin-text=\"probability\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">probability</a> theory can have any degree of belief ranging from 0 to 1. The domain of a model in FOL is the set of objects it contains. The domain is required to be non-empty. Relation: The set of tuples of objects that are related. Function: maps a tuple to a single output. Models require total functions, functions that have an output for every input tuple. Constant symbols stand for objects (e.g. ), predicate symbols stand for relations (i.e. or ), and function symbols stand for functions (e.g. ). Each predicate and function symbol has an arity, fixing the number of arguments it takes. Model checking cannot be used to determine entailment in FOL because the number of first-order models is unbounded. Term: A logical expression that refers to an object. Complex Term: Formed by a function symbol followed by a parenthetical list of arguments. Atomic Sentence: Formed from a predicate symbol optionally followed by a parenthetical list of terms (i.e. ). Atomic sentences can have complex terms as arguments. Complex Sentences: One or more atomic sentences combined using logical connectives or quantifiers. Quantifiers: Allows for statements about some or all objects in a domain. Universal Quantifier (): Asserts that a certain statement is true for all objects. For example, means \"for all , is true\". Implication is the natural connective for . Existential Quantifier (): Asserts that there is at least one object for which the statement is true. For example, means \"there exists an , such that is true\". Conjunction (AND) is the natural connective for . Uniqueness Quantifier (): Asserts that exactly one objects makes the statement true. For example, means \"there is exactly one , such that is true.\"\nConsecutive quantifiers of the same type can be written as one quantifier with multiple variables: If two quantifiers use the same variable name, the variable belongs to the innermost quantifier that mentions it.\n<br> is a conjunction and is a disjunction over the universe of objects, therefore, they obey <a data-href=\"De Morgan's Laws\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">De Morgan's Laws</a>: We can use the equality symbol to say that two terms refer to the same object.

Domain: Some part of the universe about which we wish to express definite knowledge of what the world contains. Assertions: Sentences that are added to a knowledge base. Questions: Queries or goals which receive information from a knowledge base. Axioms: Provide the basic factual knowledge from which conclusions can be derived. Theorems: Logical sentences that are entailed by axioms. Theorems add no new information, though they are essential for reducing the computational cost of inference. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Knowledge Engineering\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Knowledge Engineering</a>: The general process of constructing a knowledge base (KB).

Translate domain-level concepts into logic-level names.

This is called <a data-href=\"Propositionalization\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Propositionalization</a>. The first step is to eliminate universal quantifiers using the rule of universal instantiation, which says that we can infer any sentence obtained by substituting a ground term for a universally quantified variable.\n<br>Existential instantiation replaces an existentially quantified variable with a single new constant symbol. A <a data-href=\"Skolem Constant\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Skolem Constant</a> is used to eliminate existential quantifiers. For example, in the formula , the existentially quantified variable can be replaced by a Skolem constant , as long as does not exist elsewhere in the KB. This process is called <a data-href=\"Skolemization\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Skolemization</a>.\nNext, replace ground atomic sentences, such as , with propositional symbols, such as .\nThen, apply any of the complete propositional inference algorithms to obtain conclusions.\nOne problem is that if the KB contains a function symbol, the set of possible ground-term substitutions is infinite. This can be addressed by generating all instantiations with constant symbols, then all terms at depth 1, and so on until a proof of the entailed sentence can be constructed. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Generalized Modus Ponens\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Generalized Modus Ponens</a>: A lifted version of Modus Ponens, meaning it raises traditional Modus Ponens from variable-free <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/propositional-logic.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"88\" to=\"107\" origin-text=\"propositional logic\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">propositional logic</a> to FOL. Generalized Modus Ponens allows for the involvement of predicates and variables. For example: Substitution: A mapping of variables to terms. To apply a substitution, you replace all occurrences of a variable with the mapping defined by that substitution. Substitutions are denoted as , meaning substitute for the variable . <br>\n<a data-href=\"Unification\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Unification</a>: The process of finding substitutions which make different logical expressions look identical. This process is a key part of all first-order inference algorithms. For example, to unify the two sentences and , you can simply substitute for , . The substitution is known as the unifier.\nIf you try to unify the sentences , meaning \"John knows everyone\", and , meaning \"Everyone knows Elizabeth\", you will not be able to. This is because cannot be equal to and at the same time. This can be avoided by standardizing apart the variables. Standardizing apart a sentence involves renaming its variables to avoid name clashes. For example, you can rename the variable in to . Now the two sentences can be unified with the unifier . If there are multiple possible unifiers, it is best to choose the most general unifier. The most general unifier (MGU) is the unifier which places the fewest restrictions on variables. For example, on the sentence , the unifier is more general than . stores a sentence in the first-order KB, and returns all unifiers such that the query unifies with some sentence in the KB. can be made more efficient by not attempting to unify sentences that clearly have no chance of unifying. This can be done by implementing indexing. Predicate indexing buckets facts by their predicate and stores them in a hash table. For example, the facts may be stored in one bucket, and the facts in another.\n<br>Given a sentence to be stored, it's possible to construct indices for all possible queries that unify with it. These queries form a <a data-href=\"Subsumption Lattice\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Subsumption Lattice</a>, where the child of any node is obtained from its parent by a single substitution, and the highest common descendant of any two nodes is the result of applying the most general unifier. <br>\nThe forward-chaining algorithm discussed earlier works for KBs of propositional definite clauses. Though, not all first-order sentences can be expressed as a <a data-href=\"Definite Clause\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Definite Clause</a>—a clause with exactly one positive literal. Existential quantifiers aren't allowed, and universal quantifiers are left implicit. An example of a first-order definite clause is: Since the universal quantifier is implicit, the sentence means that all which is greedy and a king, is evil. A first-order forward-chaining algorithm starts from the known facts, and triggers all the rules whose premises are satisfied, adding their conclusions to the knowledge base. This is repeated until the query is answered, or no new facts can be derived. A fact is not new if it is just a renaming of an existing fact. A sentence is a renaming of another if they're identical except for the names of their variables.\nIf no new inferences are possible on a KB, then the KB is called a fixed point of the inference process. Forward-chaining can be made more efficient by considering the conjunct ordering problem—finding an ordering of the conjuncts in the premise so that the total cost of inference is minimized. <br>The minimum-remaining-values (MRV) heuristic would suggest an ordering where the next variable to be assigned a value is the variable with the least amount of valid values available. This is an example of <a data-href=\"Pattern Matching\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Pattern Matching</a>, and is very similar to the previously discussed constraint satisfaction problems. We can view each conjunct as a constraint on the variables that it contains.\n<br><a data-href=\"Rete Algorithm\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rete Algorithm</a>: A pattern matching algorithm which preprocesses the set of rules in the KB to construct a <a data-href=\"Rete Network\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rete Network</a>—A graph data structure where each node is a literal from a rule premise. Variable bindings flow through the network and are filtered out when they fail to match a literal. If two literals in a rule share a variable, then the bindings from each literal are filtered through an equality node.\nRete networks are a key component to production systems and in cognitive architecture. Backward chaining over definite clauses works backwards from the goal, chaining through rules to find known facts that support the proof. Logic Programming: Programming paradigms based on formal logic systems. In logic programming, program statements express facts and rules about some problem domain, and computation is performed via logical inference. <br><a data-href=\"Prolog\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prolog</a> and <a data-href=\"Datalog\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Datalog</a> are two common logic programming languages. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Resolution\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Resolution</a>: Here, we extend resolution to FOL. The first step to perform resolution is to convert the sentences in the KB into <a data-href=\"Conjunctive Normal Form\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Conjunctive Normal Form</a> (CNF). That is, a conjunction (AND) of clauses, where a clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals. In CNF, literals can contain variables, which are considered to be universally quantified. Every FOL sentence can be converted into an equivalent CNF sentence. To convert a sentence to CNF, you may have standardize variable names, that is, for sentences that use the same variable name twice, you must change one of them.\n<br>You also may have to Skolemize a sentence. That is, eliminating existentially quantified variables with a <a data-href=\"Skolem Function\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Skolem Function</a>. These are functions which take as arguments all the universally quantified variables in scope of the existential quantifier. For example: Where is a Skolem function. The resolution rule for first-order clauses is a lifted version of the propositional rule discussed earlier. Two clauses, which are assumed to be standardized apart, can be resolved if they contain complementary literals. This is called the binary resolution rule, because it resolves two literals, and it isn't a complete inference procedure by itself. The full resolution rule resolves subsets of literals in each unifiable clause.\nAnother approach is first-order factoring, which reduces two literals to one if they are unifiable. The unifier must be applied to the entire clause. This combined with binary resolution is complete. Resolution is refutation-complete, meaning, that if a set of sentences is unsatisfiable, then resolution will always be able to derive a contradiction. Ground Resolution Theorem: States that propositional resolution is complete for ground sentences. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Herbrand Universe\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Herbrand Universe</a>: If is a set of clauses, then the Herbrand universe of , denoted , is the set of all ground terms constructible from the function symbols in , and the constant symbols in ; if none, then a default constant symbol, . Saturation: If is a set of clauses and is a set of ground terms, then , the saturation of with respect to , is the set of all ground clauses obtained by applying all possible consistent substitutions of ground terms in for variables in .\nHerbrand Base: The saturation of a set of clauses with respect to it's Herbrand universe is called the Herbrand base of , denoted <br><a data-href=\"Herbrand's Theorem\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Herbrand's Theorem</a>: If a set of clauses is unsatisfiable, then there exists a finite subset of that is also unsatisfiable. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Equational Unification\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Equational Unification</a>: The process of finding a substitution for variables in a set of equations that makes the equations become identical. Strategies for finding proofs by resolution efficiently include: <br>Unit Preference: Preferring resolutions where one of the sentences is a single literal, called a unit clause.

Subcategories inherit properties from their superclass. Subclass relations organize categories into taxonomic hierarchies.\nTaxonomy: A hierarchical classification of entities into categories.\nInteraction with the world takes place with objects, while most reasoning happens at the level of categories. Categories also serve to make predictions about objects. The general framework of concepts is called an upper ontology.\nGeneral-Purpose Ontology: An ontology that should be applicable in any special-purpose domain, with the addition of domain-specific knowledge.\nSpecial-Purpose Ontology: An ontology engineered for a particular domain. <br>\nWe will use <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/first-order-logic.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"12\" to=\"29\" origin-text=\"first-order logic\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">first-order logic</a> (FOL) to represent knowledge in this chapter, although FOL has some representational limitations. The main difficulty being that in the real-world, most generalizations have exceptions or only hold to a degree. We can represent categories in FOL as predicates or objects. For example, can say that object belongs to the class.\nWe can also define an object called , and use to say the same thing.\nWe can define properties of a class by saying . Exhaustive Decomposition: The process of breaking sets into subsets, such that all elements belong to a subset. If an exhaustive decomposition is made up of disjoint sets, it is called a partition. Categories are disjoint if they have no members in common. We'll use the relation to say that one thing is a part of another. This allows us to group objects into hierarchies. <br>The relation is <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Transitive Property\" data-href=\"Transitive Property\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/transitive-property.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">transitive</a> and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Reflective Property\" data-href=\"Reflective Property\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">reflective</a>. The world can be seen as composed of primitive objects, of which, composite objects are made of. Categories of composite objects are often characterized by structural relations among parts.\nA bunch is a collection of objects that are grouped together based on certain criteria and can be considered as a composite object. Logical Minimization: Defining an object in its most efficient form, while preserving its original definition. Measures are the values assigned to properties like height or mass.

For example, the <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/ordinal-data.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"133\" to=\"140\" origin-text=\"ordinal\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">ordinal</a> measure may have values .

Some categories have strict definitions, like that of a square or a circle. Most categories in the real-world are natural kind categories, which have no clear-cut definition. This presents a challenge for logical agents, as they must identify atypical objects as still belonging to the same category. For instance, an agent should categorize a three-wheeled car as a car, even though most cars have four wheels. Intrinsic properties belong to the substance of the object itself and is independent of external conditions or quantity. For example, the boiling point of an object is intrinsic. Extrinsic properties are properties which depend on external factors or quantity. For example, weight or volume is an extrinsic property, since it changes with quantity. Count nouns are nouns whose quantities are described by a discrete number of individual entities. For example, books are a count noun. Categories described only by intrinsic properties are count nouns. Mass nouns are objects whose quantity is described by continuous measures. For example, water is a mass noun typically quantified using measures like fluid mass. Categories described by any extrinsic properties is a mass noun. Event: Actions or occurrences that can change the state of the world. Fluents are properties or conditions that are subject to change as a result of events. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Temporal Logic\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Temporal Logic</a>: A formalism used to reason about propositions and how they change over time. Temporal representation uses time points to describe when events happen and how they relate to each other. We assume a first time point , which describe the initial state and what fluents are true at start time. Event calculus is a mathematical formalism used to reason about events and their effects. The set of predicates of event calculus are: : Fluent is true at all time between and .\n: Event starts at time and ends at time .\n: Event causes fluent to become true at time .\n: Event causes fluent to become false at time .\n: Fluent becomes true at some time between and .\n: Time comes before time . We'll consider two types of time intervals: Moments, which have zero duration; and extended intervals, which have a duration greater than zero.\nTo establish a time scale, we first select an arbitrary moment as time 0, from which we can associate subsequent points to create absolute time points. A widely used time point is epoch time, also known as Unix time, which began on January 1, 1970, at zero seconds. This system is commonly utilized in digital environments for timekeeping and time-stamping. Physical objects can be described as generalized events, in the sense that objects are pieces of space-time. We can describe the properties of objects using state fluents, such as . Propositional Attitudes: Mental states that involve a relation between an agent and a proposition. Some examples include , or . These attitudes do not behave like normal predicates. Unlike normal predicates, which are referentially transparent, propositional attitudes are referentially opaque. Referential Transparency: An object if referentially transparent if the term used to refer to it does not matter. For example, if two terms, and both refer to the same object, referring to one term is the same as referring to the other.\nReferential Opacity: An object is referentially opaque if the term used to refer to it does matter. For example, referring to is different from referring to because the agent may not know that these terms are co-referential. <br><a data-href=\"Modal Logic\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Modal Logic</a> is designed to address this issue. Regular logic is centered around the modality of truth, while modal logic includes special modal operators that take sentences (rather than arguments) as terms. For example, ' knows ' is represented as where is the modal operator for knowledge. Otherwise, the syntax is the same as first-order logic, though the semantics are more complicated.\nIn modal logic, we need a model which consists of the collection of possible worlds rather than just the one true world. The worlds are connected via accessibility relations, one relation for each modal operator. A world is accessible from with respect to the modal operator if everything in is consistent with what knows in .\nFor example, Austin is the capital of Texas, but for an agent who doesn't know that, the possible world where Houston is the capital is accessible. A knowledge atom is true in world if is true in every world accessible from . The truth of complex sentences in derived with recursive application of this rule, along with the standard rules of FOL. Description Logics: A class of formal languages used to reason about the knowledge of a domain through structured concepts, roles, and instances. The main inference tasks for description logics are: Subsumption: Checking if a category is a subset of another.\nClassification: Checking whether an object belongs to a particular category. Semantic Networks: A graph structure where nodes are objects or events, and edges are relationships between nodes. This notation makes it easy to perform inheritance reasoning. For example, a directed edge from the node to the node represents a hierarchical relationship saying that the cat is a pet.\nNegation, disjunction, conjunction, nested functions, and existential quantification are all missing from this semantic network. Procedural attachment can be used to increase the expressive power of semantic networks. Procedural Attachment: A technique where a query about, or an assertion of a certain relation results in a call to a special procedure designed for that relation rather than a general inference algorithm. Semantic networks allow for default values for categories via an inheritance algorithm, these defaults can be overridden by a more specific value. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Monotonicity\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Monotonicity</a>: A property of logical systems which says that the addition of new information cannot invalidate previously established truths. Circumscription: A method in non-monotonic logics in which certain predicates are assumed to be false, unless they are explicitly mentioned to be true. For example, in the formula , can be circumscribed, and is assumed unless stated otherwise.\nCircumscription is a form of model-preference logic, where models with the least abnormal objects are preferred. Default Logic is a non-monotonic formalism which allows for default rules to be defined. For example, the formula means that if is true, and if is consistent with the KB, then is concluded by default.\nThe extension of a default theory consists of the original known facts, as well as all default conclusions that can be drawn from the default rules in the KB. Belief revision is the process of retracting inferences in the face of new information. If a KB contains a sentence , and we want to perform , we'd have to first perform in order to prevent a contradiction. Additionally, if other sentences are necessarily derived from , then those sentences will have to be retracted as well. Truth maintenance systems (TMSs) were designed to handle belief revision. Justification-based TMS annotates each sentence in the KB with the set of sentences which justify it, that is, the set of sentences from which the sentence was inferred. JTSMs typically assume that retracted sentences may be reconsidered, and therefore saves the sentence and it's derivations. An assumption-based TMS keeps track, for each sentence that has ever been considered, which assumptions would cause the sentence to be true. Classical Planning: The task of finding a sequence of actions which constitute a solution in a discrete, static, deterministic, fully-observable environment. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Planning Domain Definition Language\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Planning Domain Definition Language</a> (PDDL): A family of languages in a factored representation that provide a standardized way to express all actions with a single action schema, and does not need domain-specific knowledge. In PDDL, states are represented as conjunctions (AND) of ground atomic fluents. Ground meaning no variables.\n<br>PDDL uses <a data-href=\"Database Semantics\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Database Semantics</a>, that is, it assumes both the closed-world assumption and the unique names assumption.\nThere are no universal or existential quantifiers in PDDL. Action Schema: A representation of an action as a family of ground actions. A schema consists of the action name, a list of all variables used in the schema, a precondition, and an effect. For example: A ground action is applicable in state if entails the precondition of . The result of action in state is state which is the set of fluents formed by starting with , removing the negated fluents in the effect of action , and adding the positive fluents. A planning domain is a set of action schemas, and a problem within a domain is defined with the addition of an initial state and a goal. The states in the search state space are ground states, and the applicable actions in a state are the grounded instantiations of the action schema. The applicable actions are determined by unifying the current state against the preconditions of each action schema. If the unification returns a possible substitution, then that substitution is applied to create a ground action. There may be multiple possible substitutions.\nA strong heuristic is needed to improve the worst case time complexity of , where is the number of actions per state, and is the number of steps in the solution. In backward search, at each step we consider an action which unifies with one of the goal literals, but with no effect which negates a goal literal. For most problem domains, backward search keeps the branching factor lower than forward search, though it is harder to come up with good heuristics. <br>\nSAT Based Planners: Translate a PDDL problem description into <a data-href=\"Propositional Logic\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/propositional-logic.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Propositional Logic</a> by propositionalizing the goals and actions, adding simultaneous exclusion axioms, adding precondition axioms, defining the initial state, and adding successor state axioms. Partial-order planning is a planning approach as a graph rather than a linear sequence. In the graph, each node is an action, and directed edges represent that the predecessor action establishes the precondition of the successor action. Planning using a factored-representation (representing states as a set of variables with values) makes it possible to define domain-independent heuristics. Admissible heuristics can be derived by relaxing the original problem, and using the cost of a solution for the relaxed problem from a given state as the heuristic value. Problems can be relaxed by either adding more edges, or abstracting nodes together.\nThe 'Ignore-Preconditions' heuristic, for example, drops all preconditions from actions, thus, adding more edges.\nThe 'Ignore-Delete Lists' heuristic removes all negative literals from action schema effects, thus, allowing monotonic progress towards the goal.\nState abstractions are a one-to-many mapping of ground states to abstract states. The simplest way to abstract states is to ignore some fluents. Forward pruning prunes promising actions, with the risk of potentially pruning the optimal solution. A preferred action may be defined by defining a relaxed problem, and solving it to get the relaxed plan. Then, a preferred action can be a step of the relaxed plan, or an action which achieves a precondition of the relaxed plan. A problem has serializable subgoals if there exists an order of subgoals that a planner can solve in that order without having to undo any of the previous subgoals. This is not necessarily an optimal plan. The subgoal independence assumption assumes that the cost of solving a conjunction (AND) of subgoals is the sum of the cost of solving each subgoal independently. Hierarchical Decomposition: The process of decomposing a complex problem into smaller components organized in a hierarchy. In a hierarchical task network, there is a set of actions called primitive actions, with a standard precondition effect schema. Higher level actions (HLA) have one or more possible refinements, into a sequence of actions, each of which may be a primitive action or another HLA.\nIf an HLA refinement contains only primitives, it is called an implementation of the HLA. The reachable states of an HLA in state , is the set of all states reachable from for any of the HLAs implementations.\nThe reachable set of a sequence of HLAs is the union of all reachable states obtained by applying in each reachable state of , where is the th HLA in the sequence.\nGiven these two definitions, a high-level plan achieves the goal if its reachable set intersects the set of goal states. An implementation of a high-level plan is the concatenation of implementations of each HLA in the plan. Writing precondition-effect schemas for the HLAs themselves make it easier to prove that a high-level plan achieves the goal.\nThe downward refinement property says that every high-level plan that claims to achieve the goal must have an implementation that does so. Angelic semantics is a type of nondeterminism where the behavior of a system varies based on optimistic choices made by an agent or the environment. In many cases we can only approximate the effect of an HLA due to it having infinite implementations. An optimistic description approximation may overstate the reachable set, while a pessimistic description may understate the reachable set. To solve a partially-observable problem, an agent will have to reason about its percepts. The percepts will be supplied from the sensors when acting, but during planning it will need a model of its sensors. For planning, we augment PDDL with the percept schema, for example: In a fully-observable environment, we would have a percept schema with no preconditions for each fluent in the environment. In sensorless and partially-observable problems, we have to switch to an open-world assumption, where if a fluent doesn't appear, then its value is unknown. Given a belief state , the agent can consider any action whose preconditions are satisfied by . Then, the general formula for updating given an applicable action in a deterministic environment is: Where is the physical transition model. This means that is simply the set of states , where each is the action applied to all states in the belief state . To construct , we must consider what happens to each literal in each physical state in when action is applied. For literals whose truth value is known in , the value in is computed by the add/delete list of action . If the literal's value is unknown, there are three options: If the action adds , then the fluent will be true in .\nIf the action removes , then it will be false in .\nIf the action doesn't change , then it'll remain unknown. The family of belief states is defined as a conjunction (AND) of literals is closed under updates defined by PDDL action schemas. If the belief state starts as a conjunction of literals, then any update will also yield a conjunction of literals. This is only true for action schemas with the same effect for all states that satisfy their precondition. Alternatively, a conditional effect can have different outcomes based on the state in which the action is applied. The syntax for a conditional effect is . When applied to a belief state , a conditional effect makes it so that is no longer in 1-CNF form, thus, introducing dependencies among fluents and increasing the complexity. Contingent planning is the generation of plans with conditional planning based on received percepts. Variables in these plans are typically assumed to be existentially quantified. Calculating the new belief state after an action and subsequent percept is done in 2 stages: The first step calculates the belief state after the action: Suppose that percept literals are received. If a percept has exactly one percept schema, , where is a conjunction (AND) of literals, then those literals can be put into the belief state alongside . If has multiple percept schemas, then we add the disjunction (OR) of the preconditions of each schema. This takes the belief state out of 1-CNF. Online planning involves interleaving action and planning. Replanning requires some form of execution monitoring to determine the need for a new plan. Replanning may be needed if the agent's model of the world is incorrect. The model for an action may have an inaccurate precondition or effect.\nThe model may lack provision for exogenous events, that is, events that originate from outside the system. Online agents have a choice of at least 3 different approaches to execution monitoring: Action Monitoring: Before performing an action, the agent verifies that all preconditions for that action still hold.\nPlan Monitoring: Before performing an action, the agent verifies that the current plan still leads to a goal.\nGoal Monitoring: Before performing an action, the agent checks to see if there is a better set of goals it could try to achieve. Scheduling refers to when and how long an action occurs. Resource constraints refer to when an agent has a limitation on the type or amount of resources required to perform a task. Job-Shop Scheduling Problem: A problem which consists of a set of jobs, each of which require a sequence of actions with ordering constraints among them. Each action has a duration and a set of resource constraints required by the action. A constraint specifies the type of resource, the quantity required, and whether it's reusable.\nActions can also produce resources.\nA solution to a job-shop scheduling problem specifies start times for each action, and must satisfy all the temporal ordering and resource constraints.\nThe quality of a solution can be quantified using the makespan cost function, which is the total duration of the plan.\nAggregation groups identical objects together and is essential for reducing complexity. For example, a resource can be represented as instead of . To minimize makespan, we must find the earliest start time for all actions consistent with the ordering constraints. The ordering constraints can be represented as a directed graph. <br>The <a data-href=\"Critical Path Method\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Critical Path Method</a> (CPM) can be applied to this graph to determine the possible start times to the actions. A path through a graph representing a partial-order plan is a linearly ordered sequence of actions. The critical path is the path whose total duration is longest.\nActions that are off the critical path have a window of time in which they can be executed. ES is the earliest start time, while LS is the latest start time. The quantity LS-ES is known as the slack of an action. If an action has 0 slack, it is a critical task.\nTogether, the LS and ES times for all actions constitutes a solution for the problem. The minimum slack heuristic, on each iteration, schedules for the earliest possible start time, the unscheduled action which has all its predecessors scheduled and has the least slack. Uncertainty in an environment may be due to partial-observability or non-determinism. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Belief State\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Belief State</a>: The set of all states that the agent could possibly be in currently. Trying to use pure logic in sufficiently complex domains tends to fail due to either: Laziness: It is too much work to list the complete set of antecedents and consequents needed to form an exception-less rule.\nTheoretical Ignorance: There is no complete theory for the domain.\nPractical Ignorance: It is impractical to gather all the necessary information. <br>\nThis means that the agent's knowledge can, at best, a degree of belief in the relevant sentences. Degrees of belief are a value between 0 (impossibility) and 1 (certainty). Our main tool for dealing with degrees of belief is <a data-href=\"Probability\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/probability.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Probability</a> theory. The ontological commitments of probability theory and logic are identical: the world is made up of propositions, that is, sentences that are either true or false.\nThe epistemological commitments differ significantly. A logical agent believes a fact to be either true, false, or it holds no opinion. A probabilistic agent, on the other hand, assigns a numerical degree of belief to a fact. An outcome is a completely specified state, where all variables are assigned a value. An agent must have preferences among the different possible outcomes. <br><a data-href=\"Utility Theory\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Utility Theory</a> is used to represent and reason with preferences quantitively. <br>\nPreferences, as expressed by utilities, combined with <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/probability.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"54\" to=\"67\" origin-text=\"probabilities\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">probabilities</a> form the general theory for rational decision-making called <a data-href=\"Decision Theory\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Decision Theory</a>. The fundamental idea of decision theory is that an agent is rational if it chooses the action which yields the highest expected utility. This is called the principle of maximum expected utility.\nA decision-theoretic agent's belief state represents the probabilities of world states alongside the possibilities. A possible world is a complete assignment of values to variables. The set of all possible worlds, , is called the sample space. The possible worlds, , are mutually-exclusive, meaning only one world can be true at a time; and exhaustive, meaning there is always a world that is true at any time. <br>A complete probability model specifies a probability for each possible world, denoted . The total probability for a sample space is 1. This is<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Kolmogorov's Axioms\" data-href=\"Kolmogorov's Axioms\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kolmogorov's normalization axiom</a>. Events are subsets of the sample space. In logic, a set of worlds corresponds to a proposition.\nVariables in probability theory are called random variables and their names begin with uppercase letters, while the values of variables begin with lowercase letters.\nA probability distribution is a mathematical function which describes the likelihood of different outcomes for the domain of a random variable. The probability of each outcome is between 0 and 1 (inclusive), and the sum of probabilities of each outcome must sum to 1. <br>Discrete probability distributions describe the probability of each possible value in the domain of a discrete random variable and are described by a <a data-href=\"Probability Mass Function\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Probability Mass Function</a>.\n<br>Continuous probability distributions describe the probability of a continuous random variable. These distributions are characterized by a <a data-href=\"Probability Density Function\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Probability Density Function</a> (PDF). The probability of a proposition is defined as the sum of the probabilities of the worlds in which it holds: Unconditional probabilities, also called priors, refer to the degree of belief in a proposition, in the absence of any other information. Though, most of the time, we have some other information called evidence, which allows us to calculate conditional probability. Conditional, or posterior probabilities quantify the likelihood of one event occurring, given that another has already occurred. This is denoted as , read as 'the probability of given ' and is defined as: The product rule states that . Joint probability refers to the likelihood of two or more events occurring simultaneously. The joint probability denotes the likelihood of all combinations of the values of the variables. This results in a table of probabilities called the joint probability distribution.\n- A probability model is completely determined by the joint probability for all the random variables, this is called the full joint probability distribution. Probabilistic inference the computation of posterior probabilities for query propositions given evidence. We use the full joint distribution as the knowledge base for a probabilistic agent. Marginal probability is the likelihood of an outcome occurring irrespective of the outcome of other events. It is defined as the sum of joint probabilities of the event with all possible outcomes of other events. It is defined as: ; this process is called marginalization.\nUsing the product rule, we can replace with , obtaining a rule called conditioning. <br>\nThe denominator of a conditional probability can be viewed as a <a data-href=\"Normalization\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Normalization</a> constant for the distribution , ensuring that it sums to 1. We can use to denote such constants. Therefore: This means we can calculate without knowing the prior probability . A general probabilistic inference procedure can be defined as follows: We begin with the case where the query involves a single variable . Let denote the set of evidence variables who have values . Let denote the remaining unobserved variables. The query can be evaluated as: Where the summation is over all the possible combinations of values for the unobserved variables .\nGiven the full-joint distribution, this equation can answer probabilistic queries for discrete variables, though it scales poorly. For a domain described by boolean variables, it requires an input table of size and takes time to process. For this reason, the full-joint distribution in tabular form is rarely used in practice for building reasoning systems. Two events are said to be independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other. Mathematically: Independence assertions are typically based on knowledge of the domain. If the complete set of variables can be divided into independent subsets, the full-joint distribution can be factored into separate joint distributions on those subsets. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Bayes' Theorem\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bayes' Theorem</a> states that: One can avoid calculating the prior probability of the evidence by instead computing a posterior (conditional) probability for each value of the query variable () and then normalizing the results. Bayes' theorem is useful for answering queries with one evidence variable, though it is no better than the full-joint distribution for variables. Conditional Independence: Describes a situation where two random variables are independent of each other with respect to a third variable: separates and because it is a direct cause of both of them.\nFor variables that are all conditionally independent given , the size of the representation grows as opposed to . The full-joint distribution of the pattern where a single cause directly influences a number of effects, all of which are conditionally independent given the cause is defined as: <br>This distribution is called the <a data-href=\"Naive Bayes Model\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Naive Bayes Model</a>. It is naive because it assumes that features are independent of each other.\nTo obtain the probability of the cause given some observed effects , with denoting the unobserved variables, the standard inference method from the joint distribution can be used: This means that for each possible cause, multiply the prior probability of the cause by the product of the conditional probabilities of the observed effects given the cause, then normalize the result.\nThe runtime of this calculation is linear in the number of observed effects and does not depend on the number of unobserved effects.

This summary attempts to break s down the main ideas and insights from the book.\n<br>\n<a data-href=\"Data Mining\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Data Mining</a>: The process of extracting knowledge from data. Is also referred to as knowledge mining/extraction or data pattern analysis. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Data Warehouse\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Data Warehouse</a>: A centralized repository of data from multiple sources. <br>Data warehouses are typically constructed through a <a data-href=\"ETL Process\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ETL Process</a>, where data is extracted from sources, transformed into a desirable format, and then loaded into the warehouse.\nData warehouses are typically used to store historical data, allowing for long-term trend analysis. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Data Cube\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Data Cube</a>: A multi-dimensional array, where each dimension corresponds to an attribute or set of attributes. Cells typically store aggregate measures such as count or sum. Each dimension can contain hierarchies, such as yearly or quarterly, allowing for analysis at different levels. <br>\nKnowledge discovery from data is an iterative process of the following steps (steps 1-4 are different forms of <a data-href=\"Data Preprocessing\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Data Preprocessing</a>): Data Selection: Choosing and retrieving the data that is relevant for the analysis task.\nData Integration: Where data from multiple sources is combined.\nData Cleaning: Removing noise and inconsistencies from data.\nData Transformation: Where data is transformed into a form appropriate for mining.\nData Mining: Where intelligent methods are utilized to extract patterns present in the data.\nEvaluation: Assessing the patterns discovered in the previous step based on measures to determine if they are useful.\n<br>Knowledge Presentation: Presenting the discovered knowledge/patterns using intuitive methods such as <a data-href=\"Data Visualization\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Data Visualization</a> or report generation. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Database Management System\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Database Management System</a>: Software that enables users to create, manage, and manipulate a <a data-href=\"Database\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Database</a>. <br>\nDatabase: A collection of interrelated <a data-href=\"Structured Data\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Structured Data</a> . <br>\n<a data-href=\"Relational Database\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Relational Database</a>: A collection of structured tables, each which consist of a set of attributes (represented as columns), and stores entries as tuples of data (rows). Rows are typically identified using a primary key.\n<br>Most relational databases use <a data-href=\"SQL\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">SQL</a> to query the database. These queries include commands such as INSERT, JOIN, DELETE, or aggregate operators like SUM or MIN.\n<br>Relational databases can be modeled using an <a data-href=\"Entity-Relationship Diagram\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Entity-Relationship Diagram</a>. <br>\nData warehouses made up of data cubes can inherently support <a data-href=\"Online Analytical Processing\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Online Analytical Processing</a> (OLAP). OLAP allows users to explore data from different perspectives, such as time, geography, product lines, and customer segments. This allows for data analysis across multiple dimensions at varying levels of granularity.\nOLAP allows users to drill-down into more detailed/granular data, or roll-up to get more broad, summarized information. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Transactional Database\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Transactional Database</a>: A database which stores transactions, such as purchases or clicks on a website. <br>\nThere are a number of data mining functionalities such as characterization, discrimination, frequent pattern mining, associations, correlations, <a data-href=\"Classification\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Classification</a>, <a data-href=\"Regression\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Regression</a> , <a data-href=\"Clustering\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Clustering</a>, and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Outlier\" data-href=\"Outlier\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/outlier.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">outlier</a> analysis. Generally, such tasks can be classified as descriptive or predictive. Descriptive mining tasks describe characteristics of a dataset, this includes clustering or association rule learning.\nPredictive mining tasks, like regression or classification, aim to make predictions on future outcomes based on historical data. Data entries can be associated with classes or concepts. Class/concept descriptions can be derived from data characterization or data discrimination methods. <br>\nData characterization is the process of summarizing the general characteristics of a dataset. The output of data characterization can be <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Bar Chart\" data-href=\"Bar Chart\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bar Charts</a>, curves, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Pie Chart\" data-href=\"Pie Chart\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Pie Charts</a>, data cubes, and multidimensional tables. The output of data characterization can also be characteristic rules.\n<br>Common techniques for data characterization include <a data-href=\"Descriptive Statistics\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Descriptive Statistics</a>, <a data-href=\"Data Visualization\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Data Visualization</a>, and clustering. Data discrimination focuses on the comparison of the general characteristics of the target class against that of one or more contrasting classes. The forms of output are similar to those of data characterization. Discrimination descriptions expressed in rule form are referred to as discriminant rules.\n<br>Common techniques for data discrimination include classification algorithms, such as <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Decision Tree\" data-href=\"Decision Tree\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Decision Trees</a> or <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Support Vector Machine\" data-href=\"Support Vector Machine\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Support Vector Machines</a>. Frequent patterns are patterns that appear frequently in a dataset, they include frequent itemsets, subsequences, or substructures. Frequent itemsets are sets of items that are commonly together.\nFrequent subsequences are events that commonly share a particular sequence.\nFrequent substructures are patterns in structural representations like graphs or trees. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Association Rule\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Association Rule</a>: A conditional rule that describes a relationship between variables in a dataset. An association rule is made up of an antecedent - the item or set of items that suggest the presence of another item if present, and a consequent - the item or set of items that are predicted to be present if the the antecedent is present.\nAssociation rules with a single predicate are single-dimensional, otherwise it's a multidimensional association rule.\nConfidence: Indicates how often the consequent is true, given the antecedent.\nSupport: measures how often the items appear together in the dataset.\nAssociation rules can be discarded if they don't meet a specified support and confidence threshold. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Classification\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Classification</a>: The process of finding a model that categorizes a set of data objects into predefined classes. The models are derived based on analysis performed on training data, that is, a set of pre-labelled data. <br>The model may be represented as classification rules, decision trees, neural networks, or distance based models such as <a data-href=\"K-Nearest Neighbors\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">K-Nearest Neighbors</a>. A decision tree is a tree which splits a dataset based on feature values, where a path from the root to a leaf represents a decision rule. A neural network is a collection of neurons with weighted synapses (connections) between them. Each neuron functions as a processing unit that takes inputs, applies a transformation, and \"activates\" when a feature matches a specific pattern. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Regression\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Regression</a>: The process of finding a model that predicts a continuous-valued function. Regression analysis is used when the dependent variable is numeric, rather than categorical. Relevance Analysis: The process of identifying which features (independent variables) are most relevant for the prediction of the independent variable. Relevance analysis typically preempts regression and classification.\n<br>Relevance analysis techniques include statistical tests such as the <a data-href=\"Chi-Square Test\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Chi-Square Test</a>, or correlation analysis techniques like <a data-href=\"Pearson Correlation\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Pearson Correlation</a> or <a data-href=\"Spearman Rank Correlation\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Spearman Rank Correlation</a>.\n<br>Other techniques include <a data-href=\"Recursive Feature Elimination\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Recursive Feature Elimination</a>, <a data-href=\"Principal Component Analysis\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Principal Component Analysis</a>, or <a data-href=\"Lasso Regression\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lasso Regression</a>. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Clustering\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Clustering</a>: The Process of grouping similar data points together into 'clusters' where each cluster can be viewed as a class of data objects. <br>Clusters are formed based on <a data-href=\"Distance Measures\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Distance Measures</a>, which quantify the similarity or dissimilarity of data objects.\n<br>Popular clustering techniques include <a data-href=\"K-Means Clustering\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">K-Means Clustering</a>, <a data-href=\"DBSCAN\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">DBSCAN</a>, or <a

Both the Euclidean distance and the Manhattan distance satisfy the following properties: Non-Negativity: is never negative.\nIdentity of Indiscernibles: , the distance of an object to itself is always 0.\nSymmetry: <br><a data-href=\"Triangle Inequality\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Triangle Inequality</a>: , going directly from one point to another is never more than making a detour to some third point.

To compute the dissimilarity of objects of mixed attribute types, you process the attributes types together, then perform a single analysis. Suppose a dataset has attributes of mixed type, the dissimilarity of objects and is defined as: Where the indicator if either or is missing, or and attribute is asymmetric binary. Otherwise, . The computation of attribute to the dissimilarity of and () depends on the attribute type of : If is numeric, , where runs over all non-missing values of attribute . <br>\nIf is <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Nominal Data\" data-href=\"Nominal Data\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/nominal-data.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">nominal</a> or binary, if , otherwise it equals 1. If is ordinal, compute the ranks and , then treat as numeric. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Data Normalization\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Data Normalization</a>: The process of adjusting the values in a dataset to a common scale without distorting the differences in the ranges of values. A document can be represented by a term-frequency vector, with each attribute recording the frequency of a particular word or phrase in the document. Term frequency vectors are typically long and sparse, meaning they have many 0 values. Traditional distance measures are incompatible with sparse data, since the many shared 0 values would suggest that the two documents are similar, even if they're vastly different. <br><a data-href=\"Cosine Similarity\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cosine Similarity</a> can be used to compare term-frequency vectors with respect to a third vector of query words. Let and be two vectors, using the cosine similarity measure, we have: Where is the Euclidean norm of vector defined as .\nThe measure computes the cosine of the angle between vector and . A cosine value of 0 means the 2 vectors are at 90° to each other and have no match.\nCosine similarity is a non-metric measure.\nWhen attributes are binary, the cosine similarity function can be interpreted in terms of shared features. Therefore, is a measure of relative possession of shared features: <br>Which is the ratio of the number of shared attributes between and to the number of attributes possessed by or . This is known as the <a data-href=\"Tanimoto Distance\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tanimoto Distance</a>. Data preprocessing is the process taken to improve the quality of data in order to increase the efficiency, ease, and quality of the data mining process. Data preprocessing consists of: Data Cleaning: Involves dealing with missing values, smoothing noisy data, removing outliers, and resolving inconsistencies.\nData Integration: Involves consolidating data from multiple sources into one location, typically a dataset, data cube, or file.\nData Reduction: Involves obtaining a reduced representation of the data while minimizing the loss of relevant information for the data mining process.\nData Transformation: Involves normalization (feature scaling), discretization, and concept hierarchy generation. Data quality is measured using the following metrics: Accuracy: Having the correct attribute values. Data may be inaccurate due to faulty data collection, entry, transmission, or from inconsistencies in how fields are formatted. Disguised missing data occurs when users intentionally enter incorrect data in order to preserve anonymity.\nCompleteness: Having attribute values filled out. Data may be incomplete due to failure to collect, enter, or transmit the data.\nConsistency:\nTimeliness: Having the data available when needed. Timeliness may be compromised if users fail to submit data on time.\nBelievability: How trustworthy the data is by users. If users believe that the data is of poor quality, that belief in and of itself reduces the quality of the data. This is due to users not willing to use the data or take it seriously, thus, reducing the value of the data.\nInterpretability: How easily the data is understood. A missing value may not necessarily indicate an error. Each attribute should have at least one rule for handling null values. To handle missing values you can: Ignore the tuple: This is usually done if the class label is missing in the case of a classification problem, if a single tuple has many missing values, or if they're few tuples missing values. This is generally a poor choice since useful data is also being removed.\nManually fill in the values: This is only feasible for very small datasets and is still a poor method due to arbitrary values being inserted, thereby adding noise to the data.\nUse a global constant: Missing values can be replaced with a constant such as null or , though the mining program may mistakenly think there is a relationship between tuples with the global constant present.\n<br>Use a <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Measure of Central Tendency\" data-href=\"Measure of Central Tendency\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/measure-of-central-tendency.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">measure of central tendency</a>: A measure, such as the <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/mean.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"25\" to=\"29\" origin-text=\"mean\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">mean</a> or <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/median.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"33\" to=\"39\" origin-text=\"median\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">median</a> can be used to fill in the value. The mean is more appropriate for symmetric distributions, while the median is more appropriate for skewed distributions.\n<br>Use a measure of central tendency from the samples from the same class: Calculate a <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/measure-of-central-tendency.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"14\" to=\"41\" origin-text=\"measure of central tendency\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">measure of central tendency</a> using only data objects that are of the same class as the tuple with the missing value. <br>Fill in the most probable missing value: This may be calculated using <a data-href=\"Regression\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Regression</a>, Bayesian formalism, or <a data-href=\"Decision Tree\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Decision Tree</a> induction. This method uses the most information from the available data. <br>\nNoise: Random error or <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Variance\" data-href=\"Variance\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/variance.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">variance</a> present in a dataset. <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/outlier.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"23\" to=\"31\" origin-text=\"Outliers\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">Outliers</a> commonly represent noise since they stray far most other observations. Noise can be smoothed using techniques like: Binning: Performs local smoothing by discretizing attribute values using the neighborhood of observations in the sorted data. Attribute values are sorted, then partitioned into a fixed number of bins, which are consecutive disjoint sets. In smoothing by bin means, each value in a bin is replaced by that bin's mean. Smoothing by bin medians, similarly, replaces each value in the bin with the bin's median. Smoothing by bin boundaries replaces each value in the bin with the value of the nearest bin boundary. Bins may be equal-frequency, where each bin has the same number of values; or they may be equal width, that is, they have the same range. Binning is also a form of data discretization.\n<br><a data-href=\"Regression\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Regression</a>: Data can be smoothed using regression—the process of finding a function which best fits a dataset. The values of the attribute can be replaced with the regression models's predicted values.\n<br><a data-href=\"Outlier Analysis\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Outlier Analysis</a>: Techniques like clustering, scatterplots, or z-score analysis can be used to identify and remove outliers from a dataset. The first step in data cleaning is discrepancy detection. Discrepancies may arise due to human error, deliberate errors, or data decay (data becoming less accurate over time). Inconsistent data representations are also a source of discrepancies, such as inconsistent encoding schemas or formatting. Nested discrepancies occur when the correction of one discrepancy reveals the presence of another. Metadata is data about data. Metadata is useful for discrepancy detection for providing information about an attribute's data type, acceptable range, or dependencies.\nField overloading is another source of discrepancies where fields can have the same name but be of different data types.\nUnique rules say that each value in a dataset must be unique. Consecutive rules say that there can be no missing values between the range of an attribute. Null rules specify the handling of null conditions, such as whether they are permitted or not. Data scrubbing tools, such as spell-checking, make use of domain knowledge to detect and correct errors. Data auditing tools analyze the data to find rules or relationships, as well as identifying objects that violate such rules. Data migration tools allow simple transformations, such as renaming of attributes. Extraction/Transformation/Loading (ETL) tools provide users with a GUI for performing transformations. Careful data integration can help reduce the amount of data cleaning needed by avoiding redundancies and inconsistencies. One of the biggest problems in data integration is the entity identification problem, which is the problem of identifying which real-world entities correspond to which data objects. This includes the schema integration and object matching processes. <br>Redundancy occurs when two columns refer to the same measure, or when a column can be derived for the other attributes. The former typically occurs when there is no standard for dimension naming, resulting in one attribute having multiple different names. Some redundancies can be detected using correlation analysis methods. This includes the <a data-href=\"Chi-Square Test\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Chi-Square Test</a> for nominal attributes, or the correlation coefficient and <a data-href=\"Covariance\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Covariance</a> for numerical attributes. The chi-square test is performed as follows: <br>Suppose attribute has distinct values, . Attribute has distinct values, . The tuples described by and can be represented by a <a data-href=\"Contingency Table\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Contingency Table</a> of dimensions . Each possible tuple has its own cell in the table. The value is computed as: Where is the observed frequency of the tuple , and is the expected frequency of the tuple calculated as: <br>Where is the number of data tuples. The statistic assumes the two attributes to be independent, the test is based on a significance level with <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Degree of Freedom\" data-href=\"Degree of Freedom\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Degrees of Freedom</a>. The correlation coefficient between two attributes and can be calculated as: <br>Where is the number of data tuples, and are the respective mean values of and , and is the <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/standard-deviation.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"8\" to=\"26\" origin-text=\"standard deviation\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">standard deviation</a>. The returned correlation coefficient is between +1 and -1, where a positive value indicates a positive correlation, a negative value indicates a negative correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation. Correlation and covariance are similar measures for assessing the relationship between two attributes. The covariance between and is: Note that a covariance of 0 does not necessitate independence. Data reduction techniques result in a reduced representation of the data while minimizing the amount of relevant information lost. Common data reduction strategies include: <br>Dimensionality Reduction: Involves reducing the number of attributes in the data. Common techniques include <a data-href=\"Principal Component Analysis\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Principal Component Analysis</a> and <a data-href=\"Wavelet Transform\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Wavelet Transform</a>.\nNumerosity Reduction: replaces the original dataset with smaller forms, such as parametric and non-parametric machine learning models.\nCompression: Data compression transforms the data into a reduced form. Lossy compression occurs when only an approximation of the original data can be reconstructed from the compressed version. If the compression technique results in no information loss then it is lossless compression. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Discrete Wavelet Transform\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Discrete Wavelet Transform</a>: The DWT is a linear signal processing technique which transforms a data vector into a equal-length vector of wavelet coefficients. The data is reduced by setting all coefficients under a given threshold to 0, thus making it a sparse vector. Therefore, operations that can take advantage of this sparsity can exploited. DWT can also be used to smooth out noise in a dataset. The general steps for applying a DWT is as follows: The length if the input vector must be a power of two,. If not the vector can be padded with zeros as necessary.\nEach transform applies a smoothing function, such as a weighted mean. Then a weighted difference is applied to bring out the details of the dataset.\nThese two functions are applied to pairs of points in . This results in two datasets of length .\nThe two functions are applied recursively until the resulting datasets are of length 2.\nSelected values are obtained and designated the wavelet coefficients. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Principal Component Analysis\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Principal Component Analysis</a>: Reduces a -dimensional dataset into dimensions where is a user-specified hyperparameter and . PCA reduces the dimensionality by combining certain attributes, thereby creating a smaller subset of attributes without entirely removing dimensions.

Attribute Subset Selection: The process of entirely removing attributes that are redundant or irrelevant for the data mining task. This can be done manually by a domain expert, though it is almost always better to be performed analytically using one of the following techniques: Forward Selection: Start with an empty set of attributes and at each iteration, add the best attribute.\nBackward Elimination: Start with the full set of attributes, and at each iteration, remove the worst attribute.\n<br>Decision Tree Induction: Create a <a data-href=\"Decision Tree\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Decision Tree</a> of the given data, and attributes that do not appear in the tree can be assumed to be irrelevant. <br>\nHistograms: A visualization technique that uses binning to approximate data distributions. A histogram partitions a distribution into consecutive disjoint subsets known as bins. Bins often represent a continuous <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/range.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"36\" to=\"41\" origin-text=\"range\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">range</a> of values for an attribute. An equal-width histogram has a uniform range for each bin.\nAn equal-frequency histogram has a uniform number of samples in each bucket. <br>\n<a data-href=\"Clustering\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Clustering</a>: The process of partitioning a dataset of objects into clusters such that intra-cluster items are similar and inter-cluster items are dissimilar. Similarity can be defined using a <a data-href=\"Distance Measure\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Distance Measure</a> such as <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Euclidean Distance\" data-href=\"Euclidean Distance\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/euclidean-distance.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Euclidean distance</a>. The quality of a cluster can be quantified by its diameter, which is the maximum distance between any two values in the cluster. The centroid distance is another measure of cluster quality which is defined as the average distance of each object in the cluster from the cluster's centroid. The centroid is the average point in space of the cluster.\nClustering can be used for data reduction by replacing the actual data with the cluster representations of the data. Sampling: Can be used as a data reduction method by selecting a subset of the data objects in the whole dataset. Common sampling techniques include: Simple random sample without replacement: Drawing tuples randomly from the dataset and removing the chosen tuple from the drawing pool.\nSimple random sample with replacement: Drawing samples randomly without removing them from the pool.\nStratified Sample: Performing simple random sampling from mutually disjoint subsets of the dataset, called strata. This is useful for skewed datasets to ensure equal representation from the entire distribution. Data cubes are multidimensional representations of data stored in data warehouses. Data cubes typically store aggregated data (e.g. Yearly Sales). Each cell holds an aggregate data value and each dimension represents a different level of abstraction (e.g. Yearly). The cube at the lowest abstraction level is the base cuboid. This typically corresponds to individual entity such as sales.\nThe cube at the highest level of abstraction is the apex cuboid. It summarizes the data across all dimensions. Data Transformation: The process of converting data from one form into another to prepare for mining. Common transformation strategies include: Smoothing: The process of removing noise from data. This includes binning, regression, and clustering.\nFeature Engineering: The process of constructing new features from existing features.\nAggregation: Summarizing data at a higher level of abstraction, such as calculating average monthly sales rather than daily sales.\nNormalization: Changing values of attributes to a uniform scale.\nDiscretization: Converting continuous range values into discrete categories.\nConcept Hierarchy Generation: Where specific attributes can be generalized to to higher levels of abstraction by organizing data into a tree structure. Lower levels of the tree are more specific, higher levels are more broad. <br>\nTo avoid having the unit of measurement impact the results of the data mining process, it is recommended to normalize the data to a common range. Normalization is particularly important for distance-based algorithms like <a data-href=\"K-Nearest Neighbors\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">K-Nearest Neighbors</a> or <a data-href=\"K-Means Clustering\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">K-Means Clustering</a>. Normalization is also critical for <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Neural Network\" data-href=\"Neural Network\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Neural Networks</a>, because the backpropogation algorithm performs significantly better if input values are normalized. <br><a data-href=\"Min-Max Normalization\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Min-Max Normalization</a>: A linear transformation which maps a set of values to a new range by computing: <br><a data-href=\"Z-Score Normalization\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Z-Score Normalization</a>: Normalizes the data to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, and is computed as: Decimal Scaling: Normalizes by moving the decimal point of the values. Decimal scaling is computed as: Where is the smallest integer such that . Discretization techniques are supervised if they use class information to perform its discretization, else, its unsupervised. Top-down discretization techniques start from the entire attribute range and split the range into intervals. Bottom-up techniques start with individual values and merge them to form intervals. Binning, as mentioned previously, can be used as an unsupervised, top-down discretization technique.\nClustering: Can be used to generate concept hierarchies with top-down or bottom-up algorithms.\n<br>Classification Decision Trees: Can be used as a supervised top-down discretization technique. The main idea is to split points in a way that maximizes information gain. This is the split point which results in partitions that contain as many tuples of the same class as possible. The reduction in <a data-href=\"Entropy\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Entropy</a> is what quantifies the information gain.\nChiMerge: A supervised bottom-up discretization technique based on the chi-squared test. tests are performed on each pair of adjacent values and pairs with the lest values are merged together. <br>\nConcept Hierarchy: A concept hierarchy for <a href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/notes/math/nominal-data.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" from=\"26\" to=\"33\" origin-text=\"nominal\" class=\"internal-link virtual-link-a\">nominal</a> attributes is a tree-like structure which groups categories into broader categories or classes. Leaves typically represent specific values, such as 'cat' or 'dog', and nodes represent higher level categories such as 'animals'. Manual definition of concept hierarchies can be a tedious task, though, there are methods for more efficient generation: Specification of a partial ordering of attributes at the schema level. A domain expert can define a ordering on attributes at the schema level, such as food &gt; fruits &gt; citrus &gt; lemon.\n<br>A system can automatically generate a hierarchical ordering using a <a data-href=\"Heuristic\" href=\"https://emujakic.github.io/TechKB/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Heuristic</a> function. One common heuristic is the number of distinct values in the domains of each attribute. More granularized attributes tend to have more distinct values, for example, there are more countries then there are continents. Some manual adjustments may be needed by users. J. Han and M.
